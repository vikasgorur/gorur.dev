title: "Programming as Theory Building"
---

Claims made in the paper and what I think about them:

Programming is about modelling the real world by symbol manipulation in the computer.

There is a "theory" of the program that's not in the program text, nor in supporting documentation. This theory allows the original programmers to make modifications without fucking up.

The programmer building the theory & the program makes a crucial decision: which parts of reality to model and which ones to leave out.

The cost of program modification is not in the text manipulation.

The theory cannot be expressed in any form. It only lives in the minds of the programmers.

There can be no "method" of programming. Just as: in math problem solving or in doing science there is no "meta" advice for how to generate ideas or hypotheses, there is no "rational" method for how to do programming (= theory building).

Programming is not an industrial process.

Programmers should have the same status as professionals like lawyers and doctors.

End notes:

SQLite is in the public domain: https://sqlite.org/draft/copyright.html The original developers offer support as well and make a living that way. Why does anyone buy this? Because the original developers have the theory of the program.
