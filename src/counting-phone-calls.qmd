*My telephone rings 12 times each week, the calls being randomly distributed among the 7 days. What is the probability
that I get atleast one call each day?*

```{julia}
function phonecalls()
    # True if there is at least one call per day
    oneperday(days::Vector{Int}) = !any(d -> d == 0, days)

    N = 10000000
    days = zeros(Int, 7)
    count = 0
    for _ in 1:N
        for _ in 1:12
            days[rand(1:7)] += 1
        end
        if oneperday(days)
            count += 1
        end
        fill!(days, 0)
    end
    count / N
end

phonecalls()
```

Total number of ways to assign the calls: $7^{12}$

Atleast one per day:

$$
{\binom{12}{7} \cdot 7! \cdot 7^5}
$$
