6. There are 20 people at a chess club on a certain day. They each find opponents and start playing. How many possibilities are there for how they are matched up, assuming that in each game it _does_ matter who has the white pieces?

Let the players be numbered $1..20$. Each permutation of the list can be considered a pairing, if you draw bars like so:

$$
1 \, 3 \, | \, 4 \, 6 \, | \, 2 \, 5  \,|\, ...
$$
The total number of permutations is $20!$
