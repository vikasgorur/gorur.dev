## Machine Learning

This is my attempt to build the "tech tree" of ML, starting from the absolute basics and ending up somewhere around GPT-4.

## Programs for Humans
> Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.

These are programs I write solely to understand something and maybe help another human understand it.
