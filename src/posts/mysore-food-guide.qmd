These are my opinions but they are also correct.

**Rating scale:**

This is loosely based on the Michelin system, in which three means "a destination", two means "worth a detour" and one means "very good".

| Rating | Interpretation                                                                                                                    |

| ★★★    | A place with a distinct identity or uniquely Mysore flavor. These are the places you should prioritize if you're visiting Mysore. |
| ★★     | The best place in Mysore for a specific category. Consult this list if you're craving something specific (e.g., pizza).           |
| ★      | Acceptable. Use this list if you just need to grab something quick nearby.                                                        |

## Three star
★★★ **SAPA** \
_Bakery, lunch & dinner, desserts_ ([map](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BbfK8VUvm225Bp2j6))

<div class="indent">
A Mysore institution. Set in a converted old bungalow with outdoor and indoor seating. The only place to get good European style breads (sourdough is the house specialty). Excellent savoury dishes and fantastic desserts.

★★★ **burgerie** \
_Comforting vegan burgers and lunch_ ([map](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZJuqMNStQXGNt8Mm6))

<div class="indent">
A passionate chef cooks a limited menu of burgers and lunch bowls. The rice & dal lunch bowls are the embodiment of the flavors of south Karnataka cuisine.

★★★ **Gayatri Tiffin Room (GTR)** \
_Dosa with a long-standing reputation_ ([map](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rLYqUp4jJmJd5gPW9))

<div class="indent">
Beloved by generations of Mysoreans for their morning dosa. Best paired with a robust hike up the steps of Chamundi hill ([start here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Mse6Vm3zfQPxwPkKA)). Pro-tip: skip the crowds at the much-hyped Mylari dosa and go to GTR instead. Mylari is a worthwhile experience on its own but its hype has far overtaken its quality.
