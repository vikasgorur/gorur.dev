title: Teaching a neural network about leap years 
---

A simple net with a single layer of (12, 1) and no bias learns the leap
year function almost perfectly.

It only gets centuries not divisible by 400 wrong!

Investigate this mystery.

What I learned so far:

- The (12, 1) net thinks that all centuries are leap years, when it should only consider centuries that are divisible by 400 as leap years.
- Increasing the capacity by adding hidden layers or making the layers wider doesn't help.

This might be happening because of imbalanced data. Only < 0.1% of years fall into either the รท100 or รท400 buckets. Maybe balancing the dataset will fix the problem?

Jul 14:

- If I change the training dataset to have 50% leap years and 50% non leap years, the entire model's accuracy becomes 50%!

- Accuracy is 0.9921 if leap years 20% and non leap years 80% in the training set.

Next: try every value 1-99% leap year and graph the accuracy against that.
