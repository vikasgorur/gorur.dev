    "text": "This annotation is for the paper (Li 2022)\n\n\n\nLast updated: Oct 7, 2024.\n\nThere are two fundamental approaches to language modeling: one based on probability theory and the other based on language theory (grammars).\nA language model is a probability distribution defined on a word (token) sequence. More seriously, the probability of a given sequence of words \\(w_1, w_2, ..., w_N\\) is the product of successive conditional probabilities:\n\nprobability of the second word given the first\nprobability of the third word given the first and second\nand so on\n\n\\[\np(w_1, w_2, ..., w_N) = \\prod_{i=1}^{N} p(w_i | w_1, w_2, ..., w_{i-1})\n\\]\nMarkov invented the concept of Markov processes when studying language. See (Hayes 2013) for a fascinating history of how he analyzed the text of Pushkin’s Eugene Onegin by hand.\nAn \\(n\\)-gram language model assumes that the probability of a word depends only on the words at the previous \\(n - 1\\) positions. This kind of model is a Markov chain of the order \\(n - 1\\).\nShannon (1948) defined the concepts of entropy and cross-entropy. The cross-entropy is a measure of how well the model has learned the “true” probability. What is this true probability? I think it’s just the probability computed using frequencies in the training corpus.\nThe other approach to language modeling was the hierarchy of grammars proposed by Chomsky in 1956. This is not at all influential anymore. Chomsky thought that finite state grammars (like n-gram models) are limited and that context-free grammars can model language more effectively.\nYoshua Bengio (2003) (Turing Award 2018) first used neural networks for language modeling. Their paper had two key ideas:\n\nWords (tokens) have a “distributed representation” as vectors. This is the embedding.\nThe language model is a neural network.\n\nThe number of parameters of this model is of the order \\(O(V)\\) where \\(V\\) is the size of the vocabulary.\nThe next step in neural language modeling was the use of recurrent neural networks (RNNs). See Karpathy (2015) on their “unreasonable effectiveness”.\nA “conditional” language model calculates probability of word sequence under the condition of a previous sequence. These are the seq2seq models. These models can do tasks such as machine translation where the input and output are both sequences of tokens.\nSeq2seq models led to the transformer and pre-trained language models. A pre-trained model:\n\nUses a large corpus to do unsupervised learning to train the parameters.\nThe model is then fine-tuned with a small number of examples to adapt the model to a specific task.\n\nThis paper claims that language models don’t have reasoning, only association. I think that claim stopped being true mere months after this paper was published.\nIt is known that human language understanding is based on representations of concepts in many modes: visual, auditory, tactile, olfactory. Can AI language models learn from multiple modes as well?\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nHayes, Brian. 2013. “First Links in the Markov Chain.” American Scientist 101 (2). https://doi.org/10.1511/2013.101.92.\n\n\nKarpathy, Andrej. 2015. “The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks.” https://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/.\n\n\nLi, Hang. 2022. “Language Models: Past, Present, and Future.” Communications of the ACM 65 (7). https://cacm.acm.org/research/language-models/.\n\n\nShannon, Claude E. 1948. “A Mathematical Theory of Communication.” Bell System Technical Journal 27. https://people.math.harvard.edu/~ctm/home/text/others/shannon/entropy/entropy.pdf.\n\n\nYoshua Bengio, Pascal Vincent, Rejean Ducharme. 2003. “A Neural Probabilistic Language Model.” Journal of Machine Learning Research 3 (Feb). http://www.jmlr.org/papers/v3/bengio03a.html."

The number of ways to do this is: \\({12 \\choose 7} \\cdot 7!\\). Each of the remaining 5 calls can happen on any of the 7 days, so the number of ways is \\(7^5\\). Putting it all together the probability we want is:\n\\[\n\\frac{{12 \\choose 7} \\cdot 7! \\cdot 7^5}{7^{12}}\n\\]\nimport math\n\nmath.comb(12, 7) * math.factorial(7) * 7**5 / 7**12\n\n4.846960025159585\nWell, that’s not right.

    "text": "Problem: how long will this job run?\nA note about finding problems. When I used to endlessly consume ML textbooks, videos, blog posts, I always came away a bit dissatisfied and feeling like I hadn’t really learned anything. Will the method I just learned work on anything other than the Iris dataset from 1936? Learning that way skipped over one of the hard parts of doing ML: figuring out what kind of model would even work for a given problem. If you have felt the same way, I encourage you to find problems and datasets from your own life, or atleast find a different dataset on your own and try to apply your newly learned techniques to it.\nFor this post I’ve assembled a dataset from a problem I encountered myself. Assume there is an ML training job that you want to run on datasets of varying sizes. It’s not important what the job does. The only intuition we need is the reasonable expectation that the running time of the job is proportional to the number of training examples in a given run. We can scatter plot the data and confirm this intuition.\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\nmetrics = pd.read_csv(\"data/metrics.csv\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven that we have one continuous input variable n and we wish to predict another continuous variable duration, the simplest model to try is a line that is closest to all the points. For reasons of convention we’ll denote our input as the vector \\({\\textbf X}\\) and the output as the vector \\({\\textbf Y}.\\)\n(Note that we’re scaling both \\({\\textbf X}\\) and \\({\\textbf Y}\\) values to be in the range \\([0, 1]\\). This is necessary for most ML algorithms to work well, but I don’t understand it deeply enough to explain in this post.)\n\ndef scale(v):\n    return (v - v.min()) / (v.max() - v.min())\n\n\nX = scale(metrics[\"n\"].to_numpy())\nY = scale(metrics[\"duration\"].to_numpy())\n\nNow we can write our model as:\n\\[\n{\\textbf Y} = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1 {\\textbf X}\n\\]\nIn Python:\n\ndef prediction(X, θ):\n    return θ[0] + θ[1] * X\n\nNote that we’re multiplying a vector X with a scalar θ[1]. This works because NumPy supports broadcasting; see notes at the end of this post."

    "text": "Learning the parameters\nThe model above describes an infinite number of lines. To find a specific line that best fits the available data, we need to find the values of \\(\\theta_0\\) and \\(\\theta_1\\). We’re also making the assumption that such a line will help us predict the output variable on unseen future data. For more complicated models this is not true by default and special measures need to be taken to reduce overfitting.\nHow can we find the parameter values? The answer is one of the most important ideas in ML:\nThe parameters of a model are found by minimizing a loss function.\nThe loss function (also called the cost or objective) is a measure of how well a model fits its training data. Thus it is a function of both the parameters of the model and the training data.\nIn our problem we want the loss value to be 0 if the prediction values (denote as \\({\\hat {\\textbf Y}}\\)) exactly match the training values \\({\\textbf Y}\\). This is not possible because our data points don’t all lie on a single line. The next best thing therefore is to find parameter values such that the loss is the lowest value possible.\nWe thus want our loss function to have the following reasonable properties:\n\nIt must measure the distance between the prediction and the correct value. If the predictions are far off, the loss needs to be higher.\nEach training example must contribute to the loss.\n\nWe can thus derive the following loss function:\n\\[\nL(\\theta, {\\textbf X}, {\\textbf Y}) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n} (Y_i - \\theta_0 + \\theta_1 X_i)^2\n\\]\n\ndef loss(X, Y, θ):\n    return ((Y - prediction(X, θ)) ** 2).sum()\n\nWhy are we squaring each of the terms?

If you imagine the loss function as a 3d surface (in this case it looks like a bowl), we start somewhere on that surface and continuously try to move downhill.\nRecall that the derivative of a function is how much its value changes when its input changes by a little bit. If the derivative at a point is positive, it means a small positive change in the input causes the function to increase. If the derivative is negative, a small positive change in the input causes the function to decrease.\nThus if our goal is to minimize \\(L(\\theta)\\), we should modify each parameter at each step by an amount that’s proportional to the derivative of the loss, but negated. Since there are many parameters we want the partial derivative of the loss with respect to each parameter, and all these derivatives considered together is the gradient.\nWe can derive expressions for the gradient by normal calculus:\n\\[\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\theta_0} &=& \\sum_{i = 0}^{n} 2 ({\\hat y}_i - y_i) \\\\\n\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\theta_1} &=& \\sum_{i = 0}^{n} 2 \\cdot ({\\hat y}_i - y_i) \\cdot x_i \\\\\n\\end{eqnarray}\\]\nIn code we’ll call this the full_gradient, since we’re using the entire dataset to compute it.

For simplicity we’ll restrict our alphabet to just the uppercase letters A-Z and space and we’ll leave the space characters unchanged. The “key” for our encryption is a single number in the range [0, 25].\ndef rotate(c: str, n: int) -&gt; str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Rotate the character c by n places, wrapping around.\n    c must be an uppercase letter\n    \"\"\"\n\n    assert ord(\"A\") &lt;= ord(c) &lt;= ord(\"Z\") or c == \" \"\n    match c:\n        case \" \":\n            return c\n        case _:\n            return chr((ord(c) - ord(\"A\") + n) % 26 + ord(\"A\"))\n\n\ndef caesar_encrypt(s: str, n: int) -&gt; str:\n    return \"\".join([rotate(c, n) for c in s])\n\n\ndef caesar_decrypt(s: str, n: int) -&gt; str:\n    return \"\".join([rotate(c, -n) for c in s])\n\ncaesar_encrypt(\"THE MYSTIC CHORDS OF MEMORY\", 13)\n\n'GUR ZLFGVP PUBEQF BS ZRZBEL'\nOur task now is to figure out the key n when given only the encrypted text and the knowledge that a Caesar cipher has been used.\nSince we want to do frequency analysis in some fashion, let’s write a function to return the letter frequencies for a piece of text. For reasons that will become clear later we’ll actually compute a probability mass function, which is just the frequencies divided by the total count of letters. We will represent the PMF as a dictionary that maps each letter of our alphabet to its probability.\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nLetterPmf = dict[str, float]\n\ndef letter_pmf(s: str) -&gt; LetterPmf:\n    s = s.upper()\n    counts = Counter(s)\n    total = sum(counts.values())\n    return {c: counts[c] / total for c in counts.keys()}\n\nletter_pmf(\n    \"So we beat on boats against the current\" +\n    \"borne back ceaselessly into the past\"\n)\n\n{'S': 0.09333333333333334,\n 'O': 0.06666666666666667,\n ' ': 0.16,\n 'W': 0.013333333333333334,\n 'E': 0.12,\n 'B': 0.05333333333333334,\n 'A': 0.09333333333333334,\n 'T': 0.10666666666666667,\n 'N': 0.06666666666666667,\n 'G': 0.013333333333333334,\n 'I': 0.02666666666666667,\n 'H': 0.02666666666666667,\n 'C': 0.04,\n 'U': 0.013333333333333334,\n 'R': 0.04,\n 'K': 0.013333333333333334,\n 'L': 0.02666666666666667,\n 'Y': 0.013333333333333334,\n 'P': 0.013333333333333334}\nA reasonable way to use letter frequencies to break the cipher is:\n(Ofcourse we could argue that this is all needlessly complicated. If we already know that the text has been encrypted with a Caesar cipher, we can just inspect the results of trying all 26 keys and surely all but one of them will look like gibberish. That’s true, but in this post we’re more interested in teaching a computer to do that work for us.)\nLet’s use the complete Sherlock Holmes canon as a stand-in for the English language as a whole and compute the letter PMF.\ndef clean_text(s: str) -&gt; str:\n    return \"\".join([c for c in s if c.isalpha() or c == \" \"]).upper()\n\nHOLMES = letter_pmf(clean_text(open(\"data/holmes.txt\").read()))\nFor a moment let’s assume we have a way to measure how close two frequency distributions are and call it pmf_distance. The definition below is just a dummy, always returning 0.0.\ndef pmf_distance(p: LetterPmf, q: LetterPmf) -&gt; float:\n    return 0.0\nWe can now do the decryption:\nimport math\nimport numpy as np\n\n\ndef all_distances(cipher: str) -&gt; np.array:\n    \"\"\"\n    Return the PMF distances between the decrypted text and English (HOLMES)\n    for each of the keys in the range 0-25 (inclusive).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    return np.array([\n        pmf_distance(\n            letter_pmf(caesar_decrypt(cipher, key)),\n            HOLMES\n        )\n        for key in range(0, 26)\n    ])\n\n\ndef try_decrypt(cipher: str) -&gt; (int, str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Return the key and decrypted text, choosing the key that\n    yields the smallest PMF distance to English.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    correct_key = np.argmin(all_distances(cipher))\n    return correct_key, caesar_decrypt(cipher, correct_key)\n\nSECRET = (\n    \"ZV DL ILHA VU IVHAZ HNHPUZA AOL JBYYLUA IVYUL IHJR \" +\n    \"JLHZLSLZZSF PUAV AOL WHZA\"\n)\n\ntry_decrypt(SECRET)[1]\n\n'ZV DL ILHA VU IVHAZ HNHPUZA AOL JBYYLUA IVYUL IHJR JLHZLSLZZSF PUAV AOL WHZA'\nThis doesn’t get us anywhere ofcourse because we haven’t figured out what a good pmf_distance should be."

    "text": "Relative entropy\nThe Shannon information content of an event \\(x\\) with probability \\(P(x)\\) is defined as \\(log(1 / P(x))\\). This captures the intuition that the information obtainable from an event is proportional to how surprising it is. If you have a dog that barks at everything it’s not a very good guard dog because the bark tells you nothing and thus has low information content.\nThe entropy of a probability distribution is the sum of the information content of its events, weighted by the probability of each event.\n\\[\nH(x) = \\sum_{x_i} P(x_i) \\space log_2 \\frac{1}{P(x_i)}\n\\]\nThis too makes intuitive sense. For example, imagine a light that can be in two states on or off with equal probability. The entropy of this distribution is:\n\n0.5 * math.log2(1/0.5) + 0.5 * math.log2(1/0.5)\n\n1.0\n\n\nIn other words, the state of the light gives you 1 bit of information.\nThe relative entropy of a distribution \\(P(x)\\) compared to another distribution \\(Q(x)\\) captures some notion of the extra information we get from \\(P\\). Unfortunately the intuitive derivation of this is not at all clear to me so we’ll just have to trust the textbooks. The relative entropy is defined as:\n\\[\nD(P, Q) = \\sum_{x_i} P(x_i) \\space log_2 \\frac{P(x_i)}{Q(x_i)}\n\\]\n\ndef relative_entropy(p: LetterPmf, q: LetterPmf) -&gt; float:\n    return sum(p[x] * (math.log2(p[x]) - math.log2(q[x])) for x in p.keys())\n\nWe can also think of this as an informal kind of “distance” between \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\), while remembering that it’s not a true distance in the mathematical sense because it’s not symmetric (\\(D(P, Q) \\neq D(Q, P)\\) in general) and it doesn’t satisfy a few other distance-like properties. This distance is also known as the Kullback-Leibler divergence, a name that tells you nothing while being needlessly scary-looking.\nWe can try the decryption again, this time using the relative entropy as the distance between the distribution for each attempted decryption and the distribution for the English language:\n\npmf_distance = relative_entropy\ntry_decrypt(SECRET)[1]\n\n'SO WE BEAT ON BOATS AGAINST THE CURRENT BORNE BACK CEASELESSLY INTO THE PAST'\n\n\nWe can also visualize the relative entropy for each of the candidate keys to get a sense of how the frequency distribution with the correct key is so obviously different from that for all the wrong keys. We’ll plot the reciprocal of the distance just to make the graph prettier."

    "section": "Why use feature flags?",
    "text": "Why use feature flags?\nThis post assumes that you’re following the continuous delivery model of a single master branch into which all changes are merged.\nThe process of adding features to a SaaS application is a pipeline: product/engineering spec → code review/merge/test → QA/documentation. In any company of a reasonable size there will be multiple such pipelines active at any given time. A successful engineering organization must be able to deliver many new features quickly while not compromising on the quality of the product.\nLet us consider an example of a medium sized feature that requires changes on the backend and frontend, and which might take 3-4 weeks to move through the pipeline. In a development model that doesn’t use feature flags, we usually have to maintain a feature branch on both the backend and frontend for the entire 3-4 week period and they need to be merged and deployed together. This model has a number of problems:\n\nCode review is hard: Since the changes cannot be merged to master, it’s harder to break up the feature into small, incremental pull requests. This forces us to review the entire feature at once.\nTesting is hard: It might be too complicated to setup a new staging environment for each feature branch, thus testing would be restricted to whatever is possible to do locally. This is especially hard if your product has many third-party integrations.\nMerging is hard: When the engineer is ready to merge their code into the master branch, they might discover that changes merged by others in the intervening period cause conflicts. This problem gets worse the longer the feature remains in development. Resolving the complicated merge conflicts can easily lead to bugs being introduced.\nDocumentation is hard: If non-engineering teams such as Product Marketing or Customer Success wish to understand a feature, they have to wait until it’s in production or figure out how to use the specific test environment setup for that feature. This increases friction and causes delays.\nDeployment is risky: The frontend and backend changes often have a strict dependency and must be deployed together. If we forget this and only deploy one of them, it can lead to production issues. The feature also goes live for all customers at once, which means if something goes wrong it affects everyone.\n\nIn summary, trying to do continuous delivery without using feature flags makes the whole process a rigid and tightly coupled. Things must happen in a certain order and the stakeholders must co-ordinate closely. It’s an “all-in” jump from state A to state B, as in the diagram below:\n\nIn the feature flag model of development, enabling a flag causes the app to split into two versions, A and B. One segment of users continue to see the old version of the app, A, while another segment starts seeing the new version B. The proportions of these segments is slowly adjusted until no users see version A. At this point the flag can be removed from the codebase and as a consequence the app merges back into a single version, C. Obviously this happens to every feature flag that’s defined in the system, thus if there are \\(n\\) flags active at a given time, there could be upto \\(2^n\\) versions of the app in production. This can sound overwhelming but as long as the product areas controlled by these flags don’t overlap too much, the effective number of “different” versions is much smaller than \\(2^n\\).\n\nThis model of development is much more flexible and loosely coupled, and brings with it many benefits:\n\nCode review is easier: A feature can be split into multiple pull requests that can be reviewed and merged independently. Since everything is behind a feature flag, deploying these PRs to production has no effect until the flag is turned on.\nTesting is easier: Testing can be done in the standard staging environment or even in production, by turning on the feature for a single user. This is especially useful for testing things that have real-world interactions, like moving money.\nMerging is trivial: Merge conflicts are rare because there are no long-lived branches that have diverged from master.\nDocumentation is easier: The non-engineering teams can try the feature on staging or on production even while testing on the feature is still ongoing.\nDeployment is less risky: There is no dependency among backend and frontend deployments. Risky or large features (for example, shipping checks) can be rolled out slowly and tweaked based on real-world experience."

    "text": "When to use a flag\nAs a rule of thumb, something should be put behind a feature flag if it’s substantial, user-visible, or risky.\n\nSubstantial: If a change is really small, putting it behind a feature flag is not worth the trouble. A good rule of thumb might be: if the entire change can be a single pull request that’s no more than a few pages long, it doesn’t need to be behind a feature flag.\nUser-visible: If a change is invisible to the user and doesn’t modify any existing behavior, it doesn’t need a feature flag. Examples of such changes are refactors, backwards-compatible API changes, addition of new API endpoints, etc.\nRisky: Feature flags are primarily a tool to mitigate risk. So any change that where the cost of a bug is high should be gated behind a feature flag. This is especially important for changes that cannot be fully tested in staging environments."

    "text": "Diverge at the highest level\nAll feature flags need to be cleaned up eventually, thus it’s best to minimize the number of places where a flag is evaluated and behavior diverges. It is worth paying attention to this aspect both when writing the product/engineering spec as well as when writing code. A few examples:\n\nIt is easier to put an entire screen or a tab behind a flag rather than parts of it.\nIt is easier to add a new endpoint and deprecate the old one than trying to make the same endpoint exhibit two kinds of behavior.\nIt’s better to add new model methods, or write a new background job than add flag checks throughout the body of those methods and jobs.\n\nCode duplication is okay. Minimizing the number of if (flag) checks reduces the number of possible states we have to keep in our heads, leading to higher quality code. A temporary increase in duplicate code is an easy price to pay for it."

Now let’s say there’s a requirement to track more information than just “is finished or not?” — we want a concert to have three states: NOT_STARTED, IN_PROGRESS, FINISHED. How do we do this without a single breaking change?\nStep 1: Add the new write path\nWe add a new field state to the class and change all write paths to update both the old is_finished field and the new state field. No code is reading the new field yet. We also run a migration on the production DB to set the value of state for all existing concerts.\nclass Concert:\n    ...\n    is_finished = BooleanField()\n    state = ChoiceField(choices=[\"NOT_STARTED\", \"IN_PROGRESS\", \"FINISHED\")\nStep 2: Start reading/writing, deploy the feature\nMake changes across the codebase to start using the state field instead of the old field. This step is when we actually develop and deploy the new feature that required us to do the data model change. Most of these changes will be behind a flag.\nStep 3: Clean up\nOnce all customers are going through the new code path, remove the feature flag and remove the is_finished field entirely.\nclass Concert:\n    ...\n    state = ChoiceField(choices=[\"NOT_STARTED\", \"IN_PROGRESS\", \"FINISHED\")\nThis is a very specific example but the 3-step pattern is generally applicable. Most 1-step breaking changes can be redesigned into this 3-step shape to facilitate use of a feature flag."

    "text": "Math background\nThere is no end to the amount of math one could learn before studying ML, and usually the more I learn the more it seems to help. However, I’ve also found that it’s ok to “lazy-load” the required math once you’ve acquired a decent intuition in each of the major areas. This section therefore is just going to be a list of the areas of math that can be helpful and the best resources I’ve found for learning them.\nEver since I discovered computers my identity has been “programmer”. The book by Jeremy Kun (2021) changed my relationship to math and gave me the confidence to read the ML textbooks and papers. It helped me reconnect with my teenage self that found math playful and was excited by it rather than scared by notation. This is a life-changing book.\n\nProbability\nProbability is the foundation for all of ML, statistics, and science. It’s also way more complicated than our brief encounter with it in high school or college makes us believe. I’m always on the look out for books and articles that help in developing a good intuition for probability.\nThe textbook by (Hamming 1991) is one of the best introductions. It is rigorous enough for us engineers but more importantly has long passages that explain the intuition behind ideas.\n\n\nInformation Theory\nInformation seems like the most natural concept to try to understand ML and stats. Many of the questions of interest can be posed as information theory questions: “what has a model learnt?”, or “what did this experiment tell us?”, “how much can a model of a certain size learn?”\n(Cover and Thomas 2005) and (MacKay 2003) are two useful textbooks.\n\n\nLinear Algebra\nLinear Algebra has the worst branding in all of math. It’s more exciting to think of the subject as “thinking in high-dimensional spaces”. Everything in ML deals with vectors with impossibly high dimensions (for example, each token in GPT3 is represented as a vector in a ~50,000 dimension space).\nThe video series “Essence of Linear Algebra” by (3blue1brown 2016) was the first time linear algebra made any intuitive sense to me.\n\n\nCalculus\nML papers are full of complicated equations with symbols from multivariate and matrix calculus. This might give the impression that one needs a full undergrad course in these topics before making any progress, but I don’t buy it. I think one can get by for a long time with just the intuition of the concept of a derivative (gradient) for complicated functions and the chain rule for computing them."

    "text": "What are neural networks?\nThe first neural network was the perceptron (see Nilsson 2010, sec. 4.2.1), a single-layer network built to identify objects in 20x20 pixel images. I find it fascinating to note that most of the early work on neural networks was done by people trying to understand human cognition by building a model of computation different from the familiar digital (von Neumann) computer. From that perspective, current LLMs running on GPUs are just one physical realization of the model of computation.\nThe key algorithm for training neural networks is backpropagation. This algorithm has apparently been invented independently many times. (Rumelhart, Hinton, and Williams 1986) is one of the widely cited descriptions of it.\n(LeCun et al. 1989) is one of the first examples of using neural networks and back propagation to solve the recognizably modern problem of handwriting recognition. An interesting companion piece is the blog post (Karpathy 2022a) that re-implements the network described in the original paper and illustrates the massive difference in training time made possible by modern hardware.\nAnother milestone in the deep learning revolution is AlexNet (Krizhevsky, Sutskever, and Hinton 2012) where a deep learning model beat all other previous computer vision models on image recognition by a significant margin. This paper also illustrates the coming together of three factors that make deep learning practical and are true to this day: (1) massive datasets (2) GPUs for efficient matrix computations (3) libraries to do automatic differentiation easily."

    "text": "What is language modeling?\nThe task of language modeling is to learn a probability distribution about a corpus. The distribution is the conditional probability of the next token given a sequence of previous tokens. A short introduction to language modeling is in (Hang Li 2022).\nThe roots of this go back to Markov analyzing Pushkin’s poetry to settle a debate about free will(!), described in the article by (Hayes 2013).\nThe classic (Shannon 1948) paper that invented information theory also considers language modeling, as does his subsequent paper (Shannon 1951). In the second paper he describes an experiment to figure out the entropy of English language by giving humans (his wife and another couple) the task of predicting the next word of a short sentence, essentially treating them like modern LLMs!\nThe Shannon living-room experiments story is related in this entertaining profile: (Horgan 1992)"

    "text": "How is language modeling done with neural networks?\n(Bengio et al. 2003) introduced the ideas of using a neural network to model language as well as the idea of a “distributed representation”, also known as word embeddings. The goal of embedding is to turn words and phrases into vectors in a high-dimensional space.\nA big step forward in embeddings was Google’s word2vec paper (Mikolov et al. 2013), which contained the famous example vec(\"King\") - vec(\"Man\") + vec(\"Woman\") ~= vec(\"Queen\"). Embeddings just on their own are an incredibly useful tool in building products because they capture a general notion of semantic “distance” between words, sentences, or entire documents.\nRecurrent Neural Nets (RNNs) were one solution to the problem of capturing the sequential nature of language. The historical roots of this approach are in the cognitive science paper (Elman 1990). The blog post (Andrej Karpathy 2015) illustrates the “unreasonable effectiveness” of RNNs.\nThe playlist “Neural Networks: Zero to Hero” (Karpathy 2022b) is a step-by-step walkthrough to building something like GPT-2 starting from nothing but knowledge of Python. This entire post is in a sense is all the supplementary reading I’m doing to finish understanding all the videos in this playlist."

See LLAMA2 (Touvron et al. 2023), Mistral 7B (Jiang et al. 2023).\nThe effectiveness of neural networks is extremely dependent on the quantity and quality of the training data. This fact is apparently discovered again and again so often that it has a name: “the bitter lesson” (Rich Sutton 2019). An intriguing related fact about LLMs is the existence of “scaling laws” that describe the optimal model size and number of training tokens for a given compute budget (Hoffmann et al. 2022).\nThe wide applicability of LLMs is a result of their ability to learn to perform tasks with just a handful of examples (“few-shot learning”). This discovery is related in the GPT2 (Brown et al. 2020) and GPT3 papers (Kojima et al. 2022).\nTraining LLMs is an incredibly complicated systems engineering problem.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Last updated: Jan 3, 2025.\nHigh-level chess tournaments are typically organized in a round-robin format. Every player plays everyone else twice, once with the white pieces and once with black. A win gets 1 point, a loss is counted as 0 points and a draw gets ½ point. The player with the highest score at the end wins the tournament.\nThis raises a question: are all wins equal? Chess players have an Elo rating based on past performance and the probability of a lower rated player beating a higher rated player drops quite sharply as the rating difference increases. A player rated 100 points higher on the FIDE scale for example has a ~60% chance of winning a game (François Labelle 2016). Given this, should a win against a “weak” player really be counted as the same as winning against a player of comparable strength? Is there a better way of scoring the tournament? Would results of tournaments be affected if we used such a better way?\nThese questions were debated in the 19th century and an answer was provided by the mathematician Edmund Landau, writing his first ever publication at the age of 18. This work is described in (Sinn and Ziegler 2022) and this post is largely based on that paper."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Last updated: Nov 27, 2024.\nThese are interesting things mentioned in Why Machines Learn: The Elegant Maths behind Modern AI, Ananthaswamy (2024).\nImprinting: Konrad Lorenz discovered that ducklings imprint on the first moving thing they see after hatching. More interestingly, they can imprint on relations. If upon birth they see two moving red objects, they will later follow two objects of the same color, even if the color is different. More about this in his Nobel lecture (Konrad Lorenz 1973a) and biography (Konrad Lorenz 1973b).\nThe first artificial neuron: The paper about the first artificial neuron was a collaboration between McCulloch, a professor in his mid-40s and Pitts, a teenage prodigy who was hanging around a university and was adopted into the McCulloch home. The paper itself (McCulloch and Pitts 1943) is impenetrable, written in a formal math style reminiscient of Principia Mathematica. The important conclusion though is that combinations of the artificial neuron can implement any boolean logic.\nHebbian learning can be understood as the memorable phrase “neurons that fire together, wire together”.\nThe Mark I perceptron was a hardware implementation that could recognize handwritten characters from a 20x20 image. It was a 3-layer neural network, although only one layer had adjustable weights (in hardware, using DC motors to drive potentiometers, essentially volume knobs!). The operator’s manual (Hay, Lynch, and Smith 1960) has all the fascinating details.\nWilliam Rowan Hamilton discovered quaternions and etched it on a bridge in Dublin. He’s also responsible for notions of “scalar” and “vector”.\nA hyperplane, such as the one learnt by a perceptron, can be uniquely described by a vector that is orthogonal to it. This is in fact the vector of weights, \\(w\\).\nThe perceptron learning rule is simple, but it’s remarkable that it always converges if the dataset is linearly separable. The lecture notes (Kilian Weinberger 2024) have an accessible proof of this theorem, also reproduced in the book.\nWhen two dialup modems are trying to establish a connection they send a pre-agreed signal that lets them configure (learn) an adaptive filter to filter out the noise particular to that line. This is some of the weird sounds we used to hear! The course notes in (UC Berkeley 2011) have more details.\nAdaptive filters use the mean-squared error (MSE) as the cost function. When reading about linear regression I’ve always wondered why we can’t just use the absolute difference. One reason to prefer MSE is that it’s differentiable everywhere. Another reason mentioned in this book is that the MSE punishes outliers much more than the absolute difference.\nThe idea of stochastic gradient descent was already invented by the ADALINE project at Stanford in the 60s, which tried to solve some of the same problems as the perceptron machine.\nPaul Erdős wasn’t convinced at first that switching doors in the Monty Hall problem was the right solution. There is hope for all of us!\nBayesian statistics was used by Frederick Mosteller and David Wallace in the 1940s to figure out the authorship of The Federalist Papers.\nA concise way to remember Principal Component Analysis (PCA): The eigenvectors of a covariance matrix are the principal components of the original data matrix.\nThe support vector machine (SVM) overcomes the linear separability limitation of the perceptron. It finds an optimal separating hyperplane by projecting the dataset to a much higher dimension and finding a plane there. The algorithm to find this hyperplane works by minimizing a cost function related to the weight vector while simultaneously satisfying a set of constraints, one per data point.\nConstrained optimization required by SVMs uses something called the technique of Lagrange multipliers. It consists of defining a new function, the Lagrange function, that encodes all the constraints and then finding the extrema of it.\nThe optimal separating hyperplane of the SVM depends only on the dot produces of a few “support vectors” that anchor the margin, hence the name. However, computing the dot products in higher dimensions can be expensive (this is not very convincing to me – is it still true?). The solution is to use the kernel trick.\nA kernel is a function such that given two vectors \\(x_i\\) and \\(x_j\\) and a function \\(\\phi(x)\\) that transforms each vector to a higher dimension, the kernel \\(K(x)\\) allows one to compute the dot product in the higher dimension while only working with the lower-dimension vectors:\n\\[\nK(x_i, x_j) = \\phi(x_i) \\cdot \\phi(x_j)\n\\] The kernel trick was suggested by a French scientist Isabelle Guyon, working with Bernard Boser and Vladimir Vapnik. The trick apparently can work even when projecting to an infinite dimensional space, called a Hilbert space. The kernel in that case is called the “radial basis function” (RBF).\nAn RBF kernel can always find a linearly separable hyperplane in some infinite-dimensional space. This means that SVMs are also universal function approximators, just like deep neural networks.\nThe original SVM paper is (Boser, Guyon, and Vapnik 1992).\nGlass is a disordered solid — without an ordered crystalline structure yet not a liquid. By analogy, certain magnetic materials that have atoms or ions with randomly oriented magnetic moments (which arise due to ‘spin’) are called spin glasses.\nA simple mathematical model of spin glasses assumes that the spin of each element in a 2d or 3d array depends only on the spins of its neighbors. If such a material starts out in an arbitrary state, the spins will flip until the entire system reaches the state of lowest energy, which happens when the spins are all aligned.\nThe physicist John Hopfield (Nobel in Physics, 2024) was thinking about the problem of associative memory. How is it that when given a fragment of an image or a hint of a smell, we can recall an entire vivid memory?\nThe solution was the Hopfield network. The connections in such a network are arranged similarly to the spin glasses. For a given configuration, the weights of the neurons represent the “memory” of the network. If the memory puts the network into its lowest energy state, any distorted (noisy) version of the same memory would put the network in a higher energy state. The network however can find its way back to the lowest energy state through a dynamical process, like any physical system finding its equilibrium. Thus we can think of the Hopfield network as a system that stores a memory and can retrieve that memory when given a fragment of it.\nHopfield could only publish his paper (Hopfield 1982) because he was a member of the Academy of Sciences and thus had privileges to publish without peer review. “No refereed journal would have accepted it”. 🙃\nGeorge Cybenko proved in 1989 that a neural network with just one hidden layer and an arbitrarily large number of neurons can approximate any function. This is the universal approximation theorem.\nThe proof uses the idea that functions are vectors in an infinite dimensional space. It’s not a constructive proof but one by contradiction. It assumes that a network with a single hidden layer cannot span the entire vector space of functions and arrives at a contradiction.\nA deterministic algorithm for updating the weights of a neural network suffers from the problem of symmetry. If the initial weights are all assigned the same value (say, 0), they will be updated by the learning rule in the same way and thus effectively become redundant. The simple way to solve this problem is to initialize the weights randomly, an idea that first occured to Rumelhart.\nThe backprop paper (Rumelhart, Hinton, and Williams 1986) was the “last time” it was discovered. See (Liu 2023) for a detailed history of backpropagation.\nDavid Hubel and Torsten Wiesel did experiments on cats and figured out essentially that the neurons in the brain respond to certain “features” in the visual field, like edges.\nYann LeCun at Bell Labs in 1988 designed a neural network to recognize handwritten digits from a US Postal Service dataset (is this the origin of the famous MNIST dataset?). He wrote a compiler in Lisp that would take the architecture of a neural network and generate C code to implement it.\nHis network, LeNet, was a convolutional neural network. A 2d convolution of an image involves moving a small kernel (say 4x4) over the pixels of the image and generating a new pixel through some operation (say, average or max). The end result of this is a slightly smaller image. While these kernels could be handcrafted, it’s more scalable to let the neural net learn them. This is how a neural net learns which features are important.\nIn 2009, Fei-Fei Li presented an immense dataset of labeled images, ImageNet and an associated challenge. Use the 1.2 million images, binned into 1000 categories, to train an algorithm and test it on 100,000 unseen images. AlexNet, using GPUs for training won the contest in 2012 by a wide margin, kicking off the modern deep learning revolution.\nGrokking is a rather strange properly of deep neural networks. The cutting edge models today have parameters in the billions or trillions, sometimes outnumbering the instances of data used to train them. In theory these networks should simply overfit the data and not generalize, but that’s not true.\nOne hypothesis is that some kind of implicit regularization is happening in the training process. See also the illuminating short paper (breimanReflectionsRefereeingPapers2018?) that questions the usefulness of “theory” when doing ML research.\nLLMs are an instance of self-supervised learning. The pre-training helps the network learn some structure of language (or images, speech, …) and fine-tuning later guides them towards a purpose.\nThe theory of all this is far, far behind experimentation.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nAnanthaswamy, Anil. 2024.

    "text": "Last updated: Dec 21, 2024.\nThe backpropagation algorithm for training neural networks seemed very complicated when I first encountered it. I only really understood it after implementing it from scratch following the excellent video by Andrej Karpathy (2022). It also helped me to realize that backpropagation is a kind of automatic differentiation (AD) and can be understood without any reference to neural networks. See (Baydin et al. 2015) for an excellent survey of AD in machine learning.\nAfter understanding backprop, though, I had a different question: why did it take so long to discover and become popular? The story of that seems surprisingly complicated but a good starting point is the blog post by Liu (2023).\nWhile reading through that post a couple of quotes from Geoffrey Hinton caught my eye:\nI love learning about the history of computing so in this post we’ll try to recreate what Hinton must have done in that weekend.\nThe neural network he’s describing (“8-3-8”) is an autoencoder, whose job is to learn to simply reproduce its output as faithfully as it can. This might seem pointless, but it makes more sense when you think of the network as containing both an encoder and a decoder along with a “bottleneck” in the middle where the input vector gets squashed to one with a lower dimension. This squashing can be variously understood as a lossy compression of the input, as dimensionality reduction, or as feature extraction. For our purposes here though, it’s just a toy historical example demonstrating the value of backpropagation.\nThe input dataset for our network are the numbers \\(0\\) - \\(7\\) encoded as “one-hot” vectors.\n\\[\n0 = [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1] \\\\\n1 = [0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0] \\\\\n... \\\\\n7 = [1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n\\]\nThus the input layer and output layers both have size \\(8\\), and we’ll introduce a hidden layer inbetween of size \\(3\\), hence giving the network the name “8-3-8” encoder. The hidden layer is of size \\(3\\) because \\(3\\) bits is all you need to represent the numbers upto \\(7\\). The network and the learning algorithm are described in detail in (Rumelhart, Hinton, and Williams 1986, chap. 8) though the terminology is a little archaic.\nWe’ll implement this network in two different ways. First, using modern libraries (PyTorch and Keras) at the highest level of abstraction. Second, writing everything from scratch in Clojure (as a tribute to the Hinton version written in Lisp)."

    "text": "The English movie\nBefore we understand the new Kannada movies, we must understand English movies.\nIf you grew up in Karnataka in the 90s, especially outside Bangalore, most of this story is familiar to you. Back in the days before cable there was only DD9. We spoke Kannada almost exclusively, both at home and in school. We read our children’s stories in Sudha, Taranga, and Chandamama. Our world was small and when we watched films in the theater or on TV we just called them ‘films’ with no qualifier attached.\nOne day we watched Terminator 2: Judgement Day in a theater and barely understood anything, other than that we should feel sad when the robot drowned in the lava. Or your school took your whole class to a showing of Jumanji on a Saturday morning and you screamed in terror when the little boy’s hands started turning into sand. However it happened, we now became aware of a new concept: the ‘English film’.\nThe English film taught us lessons. The people who made these movies, wherever they lived, must be rich. After all, in their movies you could see life-life dinosaurs. They contained fantastic scenes such as a cow flying through a tornado and a bus jumping across a gap in something called a ‘freeway’. They treated real cars more roughly than I did my Hot Wheels. Surely, they must be very rich.\nAs we grew up we understood that it was possible for us to enter this land of riches, and one of the keys we needed was simply the English language. We started speaking English with our friends and made new friends who spoke nothing but English. We watched Friends and learned all the wrong lessons about relationships. We could now understand every single line spoken in an English movie, and some of us took pride in reciting entire scenes from memory.\nWe ran through an obstacle course after that, encountering creatures known as CET, JEE, GRE, TOEFL (foreign language, hah!), GMAT, and so on. The English films we watched allowed us to confidently bullshit our way through exams, ‘group discussions’, interviews or entire MBA programs. We got ourselves English-speaking jobs and moved to places like ‘Santa Cruz apartments’ in Bangalore or to Santa Clara, CA.\nThe details in the story may vary but the central plot remains the same. By the time these new-wave Kannada movies arrived, an entire generation of us had become estranged from our native tongue for a decade or more. Or maybe it was just me, as I drove an hour north of San Diego and paid $20 to watch one of these movies in a theater full of NRI Kannadigas."

    "title": "For A Kannada Movie",
    "section": "New wave",
    "text": "New wave\nAt first I was simply bothered by technical flaws in these movies. Let me list a few.\nOne, the plot often tries too hard. Rangitaranga, the movie I went to see in San Diego, was a decent horror movie until the last 30 minutes or so when it went completely off the rails and tried to cram as many ‘twists’ as possible. It reminded me of the satirical story of the Gillette executive who gives up and decides that more blades is always better.\n\nA good writer in any medium has the confidence to tell a single, cohesive story and the restraint to leave the audience wanting a little more. In Godhi Banna Saadhaarana Maikattu, it is the opposite. It has a perfectly good father/son plot (with a predictably great performance by Anant Nag) and yet it shoves in an entire 90-minute gangster movie plot for no reason, and the two threads don’t even intersect until the very last moments of the film.\nTwo, they use a variety of cinematography gimmicks ー camera upside down, shaky cam, superfluous blue/orange tinting ー but fail at the most basic shots. For example, in the scenes that need to be stitched together from multiple takes (such as two people sitting opposite each other and talking), the inexperienced actors don’t have the same energy or emotion in each take and that breaks the immersion that it’s a single real-time conversation. Even low-budget 90s Kannada movies do this very well as long as they employ trained actors.\nThree, the language just feels clunky. This is the hardest one to explain for me, but often when I hear the dialogue in these movies it just doesn’t feel like something that a Kannada speaking person would say. Partly this is due to the accents of the actresses that are so soft and delicate that it’s obvious they never grew up speaking Kannada. More frequently it’s because the dialogue feels as if it was formulated first in English and passed through Google Translate, like many of the signs we’ve become used to seeing around Bangalore in recent years.\n \n(More examples of this by @tapanguchi).\nI have barely a leg to stand on when making this complaint, though, since I certainly would not be able to write this essay in Kannada.\nIt would be fair to dismiss all of these objections as pointless rambling by a film nerd. Technical flaws don’t necessarily prevent us from enjoying a movie. The language aspect, however, made me realize that there is something else missing from all these films. They have no Kannada soul.\nWhat is this soul? It is the quality of being of a place, of belonging, and of being comfortable in one’s own skin. The 90s movies like Nishkarsha, BeLadingaLa baale have this soul. The early Upendra movies like A have this too, despite all their gimmicks. Mungaru Male has the soul, largely on the strength of its songs. Aa Dinagalu has it because the source material is so deeply tied to 80s Bangalore. Tithi, made by a first-time filmmaker, embodies the idea of Kannada soul because it tells the story of a Mandya/Mysore belt village without any attempt to filter it through a foreign sensibility.\nIn contrast the new wave films deliberately set out to be ‘different’ from all the Kannada films that came before, and this simply renders them a pale imitation of the Hollywood film. Even when they include a scene like a Yakshagana performance (in Rangitaranga) they adopt the gaze of an outsider, like that of an enthusiastic guide explaining the Mysore palace to a tourist from New York.\nWhen people write the phrase “for a Kannada movie” they mean it as a compliment, not realizing that it’s an indictment.\nEven on the surface level it’s a back-handed compliment. It’s no different than saying, “you’re dark-skinned but you’re so pretty!”. The compliment embeds an unspoken hierarchy in which the English or Hindi movie is assumed to be usually better, and the Kannada movie can only compete at the Ranji trophy level.\nAt a deeper level it is an indictment of us. It betrays our desire that our art must be judged by outsiders to be worthy. The older I get the more I have come to reject that view. Art must be judged solely, individually, by how deeply it moves us, and art made close to home has the greatest capacity to do that.\nThe lack of soul is not the fault of the filmmakers. They are just like us in the audience who have seen our own Kannada souls erode over the years. Some of us deal with it by leaning hard into the Kannada identity ー joining the Kannada Rakshana Vedike, becoming a ‘federalist’ in our politics and twitter bios, and pointing out Hindi imposition wherever we may find it. Some go the other way, pursuing the fool’s errand of assimilation into the West. Sampath from Hassan becomes Sam in California.\nThe majority of us end up in the middle. We lose our ability to write in the Kannada script, then we are unable to read anything more than a signboard. Our lives are now much more cosmopolitan. We watch shows on Netflix and expertly discuss the nuances of American cultural questions raised by them. In the back of our minds we are dimly aware that the waves coming from the west are slowly erasing the alphabets of our native language from our minds, as if they were drawn in sand, but we aren’t sure what to do about it.\nThus when we hear that there’s a new kind of Kannada movie and it’s playing in San Diego or San Francisco or London we go to see it eagerly, hoping it will transport us to the 4:30pm DD9 movie on a Sunday evening in our childhood, back to a time when it didn’t feel like we were straddling two canoes with one foot in each and barely holding on. We are disappointed, because the new wave movie does nothing to help us find our lost Kannada soul, because the people who made it suffer from the same ailment as we do. We log onto Facebook and write, “Amazing! For a kannada movie, …”."

You might think that you don’t like kesari baath, but you might have never eaten the real thing. Most darshinis don’t use real saffron in their kesari baath, but CCBC does.\nAlso try their dosa.

Quite different from the masala dosa you find in restaurants.\n\n★★★ Gayatri Tiffin Room (GTR)\nDosa with a long-standing reputation (map)\n\nBeloved by generations of Mysoreans for their morning dosa. Best paired with a robust hike up the steps of Chamundi hill (start here). Pro-tip: skip the crowds at the much-hyped Mylari dosa and go to GTR instead. Mylari is a worthwhile experience on its own but its hype has far overtaken its quality.\n\n★★★ SAPA\nBakery, lunch & dinner, desserts (map)\n\nA Mysore institution.

They only serve a small menu of deep-fried snacks and are only open 5pm - 9pm. Best to get there between 5-7pm before they start running out of stuff.

    "text": "Last updated: Apr 25, 2022\n\nI grew up in a quiet household and have always been sensitive to noise. Lately, this sensitivity has gotten much worse and I find myself complaining about it both online and to people in the real world.\nI’m writing this because I figure celebrating silence might work as a palliative for this condition.\nLike food or wine, silence not just a physical reality but a phenomenon of the mind. To me silence is really a proxy for solitude, contemplation, and a refuge from the anxiety of feeling like you might be called upon to Deal With Something.\nHere are the varieties of silence as I experience them, dedicated to my fellow connoisseurs.\n\nThe Absolute\n\nAbsolute silence can only be found in an ‘anechoic chamber’ and I’ve not had that experience. It can supposedly be unsettling to not hear any sound at all, or to hear things that one normally does not hear, such as the sound of blood vessels inside the ear.\n\n\n\nThe Desert\n\nThe silence in a desert like Death Valley with its sweeping open landscape can produce a feeling of religious awe. The wind hardly blows, there are no animals to be heard or seen. There is nothing to hear except your own footsteps or your breathing. This is a good place to make life-changing decisions.\n\n\n\nThe Canyon\n\nThe silence of the canyon is cozy. If you’re walking inside a narrow, twisty canyon it’s like being in a room with impossibly high walls that shield you from the sound of cars in the distance or other people.\n\n\n\nThe Ocean Cliff\n\nThe ocean is not quiet, but its silence is lonely. Standing on a cliff in San Francisco and looking over the Pacific ocean at night you have to wonder: what happens if you take a sailboat and go further west? What beasts lurk under water in the open ocean and what beasts might you see inside your own mind?\n\n\n\nThe Dense Forest\n\nA forest has lots of sounds, but I believe our ape-brain finds it to be the most familiar setting. You’re still more alert than you’d be in a dead desert, but the rustling of leaves underfoot or the sound of insects and birds never spikes your heart rate the way a lawnmower or an ambulance siren does.\n\n\n\nThe Museum\n\nA fine art museum bombards your brain with so much visual beauty that it tricks you into ignoring most of the sounds. The presence of all that beauty makes you walk a little slower, maybe breathe a little slower, and along with it comes a stillness.\n\n\n\nThe Academic\n\nThe academic silence can be found on the campuses of great universities, but its purest expression is in the libraries, such as the Library of Congress. In the battle against noise the librarians are the cavalry, the fanatics, the shock troops — and may the gods bless them.\n\n\n\nThe Religious\n\nAll famous temples are insanely noisy, but a small village temple can still be peaceful. The silence there I suppose is the weight of history, not just in the myths carved on the walls but the peculiar smoothness of the stones of the steps and thresholds, polished by so many feet walking on them for decades. Strangely I also felt that sort of silence at an American temple, the Lincoln Memorial, even with lots of tourists around me, because the weight of the words carved into the marble drowned out all the noise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Hotel Room\n\nThe silence of the hotel room has anonymity. Nice hotels have excellent soundproofing and will honor the ‘do not disturb’ sign on the door. No one knows you’re there and except for overly helpful staff no one’s going to knock on the door and disturb you.\n\n\n\nThe Exam\n\nThis is a nasty, foul silence. Of all the ones in this list, this is the only one you wish would be broken by noise as soon as possible. Whether you know the answers or not, this silence only produces urgency, anxiety, furtive glances at the watch.\n\n\n\nThe Road Trip\n\nThis silence is found somewhere around the seven-hour mark on a solo road trip through the American West. You’ve gotten sick of listening to podcasts, music, and audiobooks and there is nothing but enforced mindfulness. There is no past or future at this point in the road trip. The motel you left hours ago doesn’t matter, and home is still many hours away. There is nothing to do but listen to the steady sound of tires against asphalt and keep your hands on the wheel.\n\n\n\nThe Artificial Silences\n\nI suppose I should include these as honorable mentions. Whether it’s noise-canceling headphones or earplugs, the artificial silence is better than nothing but ultimately unsatisfying, much like getting drunk to suppress your sadness or drinking coffee to stay up. The real demons are still out there, just waiting for a crack in the door."

    "section": "Quality",
    "text": "Quality\nWe’ll come up with a way to rank the performance of players in a tournament by making the following assumptions:\n\nWe postulate the existence of a “quality score” for each player.\nThe quality of a player is the sum of their game results (\\(0\\), \\(½\\), or \\(1\\)) but with each result weighted by the quality of the opponent.\n\nLet’s number the players \\(1..N\\) and define a tournament matrix \\({\\mathbf T}\\) where an entry \\(t_{ij}\\) is player \\(i\\)’s total result against player \\(j\\). So for example, if player 1 won both games against player 2, \\(t_{12} = (1 + 1) = 2\\).\nThe quality of all the players can now be written as a set of simultaneous equations, illustrated here for a 4-player tournament:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nt_{11}\\,q_1 + t_{12}\\,q_2 + t_{13}\\,q_3 + t_{14}\\,q_4 &= \\lambda q_1 \\\\\nt_{21}\\,q_1 + t_{22}\\,q_2 +  t_{23}\\,q_3 + t_{24}\\,q_4 &= \\lambda q_2 \\\\\nt_{31}\\,q_1 + t_{32}\\,q_2 + t_{33}\\,q_3 + t_{34}\\,q_4 &= \\lambda q_3 \\\\\nt_{41}\\,q_1 + t_{42}\\,q_2 + t_{43}\\,q_4 + t_{44}\\,q_4 &= \\lambda q_4 \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nwhere all \\(t_{ii} = 0\\).\nIf we think of the quality scores of all the players as the vector \\({\\mathbf q}\\), the set of equations can be written as:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{T} \\, \\mathbf{q} = \\lambda \\, \\mathbf{q}\n\\] This is nothing but the definition of \\({\\mathbf q}\\) as an eigenvector!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy do we need the factor \\(\\lambda\\)? The short answer is that the theorem that will guarantee the existence of the eigenvector requires it. Another way to think about it is that the eigenvalue \\(\\lambda\\) is not guaranteed to be \\(1\\). The value of \\(\\lambda\\) doesn’t matter for our purposes though because all we care about is the ordering of values within \\({\\mathbf q}\\).\nLinear Algebra sometimes feels like just a long list of definitions, but here we encounter something non-obvious, the Perron-Frobenius Theorem:\n\nAny matrix with nonnegative real entries has a largest real eigenvalue and a corresponding eigenvector, unique up to scaling, whose entries are all nonnegative.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the intuitive understanding of \\({\\textbf q}\\) as an eigenvector? I think of it like this:\n\nFor a tournament with \\(N\\) players, there is an \\(N\\)-dimensional space where each point represents one possible ordering of the players. To keep things simple we can focus only on vectors of magnitude \\(1\\), thus each possible ordering is a point on a hypersphere.\nThe tournament matrix is a transformation on this space. It maps any hypothetical ranking \\({\\mathbf q}_\\text{before}\\) to a new ranking \\({\\mathbf q}_\\text{after}\\). The act of holding the tournament is our attempt to discover the “true” value of \\({\\mathbf q}\\).\nNow imagine we knew the “true” value of \\({\\mathbf q}\\) before the tournament. We would then expect the tournament matrix to leave the vector unchanged. An eigenvector of \\({\\mathbf T}\\) is in some sense the “axis of rotation” of the hypersphere we just mentioned, in that its direction is left unchanged when the matrix acts upon it. Thus this eigenvector is the true quality vector we seek.\n\n(The above explanation is necessarily a bit of a hand-wave because intuition demands sacrificing rigor)."

    "text": "The power method\nWe could find the eigenvectors of this matrix simply by calling np.linalg.eig(T) but there is an elegant method that also scales better to really large matrices.\nThe power iteration method can be described in one sentence as:\nIf you start with a random vector and repeatedly apply a matrix, it converges to the eigenvector with the largest eigenvalue.\nThe only further detail needed is that the vector should be normalized after each iteration to prevent it from growing without bounds. Let’s write the function and also have it return all the intermediate values because it’ll be useful later to visualize:\n\ndef power_iters(T: np.array, n: int) -&gt; list[np.array]:\n    \"Return the results of the applying the power method n times\"\n    \n    q = np.random.random(T.shape[0])\n    results = [q]\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        Tq = T @ q\n        q = Tq / np.linalg.norm(Tq)\n        results.append(q)\n        \n    return results\n\nWhy does this work?\nImagine that the eigenvectors of \\({\\mathbf T}\\) form the basis for our vector space. Ignore for a moment whether this is possible in general. When expressed in this basis, \\({\\mathbf T}\\) is a diagonal matrix, with the diagonal values being the eigenvalues. Let’s call the largest of these the dominant eigenvalue. Now if we take a random vector and repeatedly apply the matrix to it (while normalizing after each step), the dominant eigenvalue will make one of the components of the vector grow relative to the others. Eventually the vector will come to point almost entirely in the direction of that component. Given that we’re working in the eigenbasis, this vector is nothing but an eigenvector.\nAnother way to think about it is that the power method continually “pulls” a vector towards the eigenvector with the dominant eigenvalue. We can see this in action with our dataset. We’ll start with a random vector that represents an arbitrary ranking of the players. After each iteration, we’ll mark the players that rose or fell in the rankings. The scores mentioned after each player name are the 3 digits after the decimal place (so \\(0.919… = 919\\)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that the starting vector converges quite quickly to a stable ordering. We also see that it’s the same order as the one obtained by adding up the points (except for the second place group, Nepo, Hikaru and Fabi, but it would be a mistake to think that the slight differences signify anything). I suspect that in most cases the method described here produces the same ranking as just adding up points, which explains why the simpler system is still used in tournaments."

See the blog post (Jeremy Kun 2011) for a detailed description of PageRank.\nWe can even think of it as a game. If gorur.dev has hundreds of links to arxiv.org while there are no links in the other direction, arxiv.org “wins” over gorur.dev. Computing the PageRank is like ranking the web pages in this “tournament”!"
