    "text": "George Casella, Roger L. Berger, Statistical Inference, 2nd edition, 2002. Exercise 1.20.\nMy telephone rings 12 times each week, the calls being randomly distributed among the 7 days. What is the probability that I get atleast one call each day?\nLast updated: Jul 26, 2024.\nThis problem seems simple enough at first. Each of the 12 phone calls can independently happen on any of the 7 days, so the total number of ways to distribute the phone calls is \\(7^{12}\\).\nWe want each day to have atleast one phone call, so let’s first choose 7 out of 12 calls and distribute them one per day. The number of ways to do this is: \\({12 \\choose 7} \\cdot 7!\\). Each of the remaining 5 calls can happen on any of the 7 days, so the number of ways is \\(7^5\\). Putting it all together the probability we want is:\n\\[\n\\frac{{12 \\choose 7} \\cdot 7! \\cdot 7^5}{7^{12}}\n\\]\nimport math\n\nmath.comb(12, 7) * math.factorial(7) * 7**5 / 7**12\n\n4.846960025159585\nWell, that’s not right. I tried a few other ways to arrive at an answer but couldn’t be sure that any of them were correct. So I gave up and wrote code instead:\nimport fastrand\n\ndef phonecalls():\n    N = 1_000_000\n    count = 0\n    week = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    for i in range(N):\n        for _ in range(12):\n            week[fastrand.pcg32randint(0, 6)] += 1\n\n        if week.count(0) == 0:\n            count += 1\n\n        week = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    \n    return count / N\n\nphonecalls()\n\n0.228721\nI looked up the answer in the solutions manual for the textbook. It says:\nThis answer doesn’t feel very satisfying. Even if I’d come up with it myself, I would feel more confident about the correctness of my code than this answer. Why is it so complicated?\nI’m left with more questions about counting:"

    "text": "Problem: how long will this job run?\nA note about finding problems. When I used to endlessly consume ML textbooks, videos, blog posts, I always came away a bit dissatisfied and feeling like I hadn’t really learned anything. Will the method I just learned work on anything other than the Iris dataset from 1936? Learning that way skipped over one of the hard parts of doing ML: figuring out what kind of model would even work for a given problem. If you have felt the same way, I encourage you to find problems and datasets from your own life, or atleast find a different dataset on your own and try to apply your newly learned techniques to it.\nFor this post I’ve assembled a dataset from a problem I encountered myself. Assume there is an ML training job that you want to run on datasets of varying sizes. It’s not important what the job does. The only intuition we need is the reasonable expectation that the running time of the job is proportional to the number of training examples in a given run. We can scatter plot the data and confirm this intuition.\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\nmetrics = pd.read_csv(\"data/metrics.csv\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven that we have one continuous input variable n and we wish to predict another continuous variable duration, the simplest model to try is a line that is closest to all the points. For reasons of convention we’ll denote our input as the vector \\({\\textbf X}\\) and the output as the vector \\({\\textbf Y}.\\)\n(Note that we’re scaling both \\({\\textbf X}\\) and \\({\\textbf Y}\\) values to be in the range \\([0, 1]\\). This is necessary for most ML algorithms to work well, but I don’t understand it deeply enough to explain in this post.)\n\ndef scale(v):\n    return (v - v.min()) / (v.max() - v.min())\n\n\nX = scale(metrics[\"n\"].to_numpy())\nY = scale(metrics[\"duration\"].to_numpy())\n\nNow we can write our model as:\n\\[\n{\\textbf Y} = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1 {\\textbf X}\n\\]\nIn Python:\n\ndef prediction(X, θ):\n    return θ[0] + θ[1] * X\n\nNote that we’re multiplying a vector X with a scalar θ[1]. This works because NumPy supports broadcasting; see notes at the end of this post."

    "text": "Learning the parameters\nThe model above describes an infinite number of lines. To find a specific line that best fits the available data, we need to find the values of \\(\\theta_0\\) and \\(\\theta_1\\). We’re also making the assumption that such a line will help us predict the output variable on unseen future data. For more complicated models this is not true by default and special measures need to be taken to reduce overfitting.\nHow can we find the parameter values? The answer is one of the most important ideas in ML:\nThe parameters of a model are found by minimizing a loss function.\nThe loss function (also called the cost or objective) is a measure of how well a model fits its training data. Thus it is a function of both the parameters of the model and the training data.\nIn our problem we want the loss value to be 0 if the prediction values (denote as \\({\\hat {\\textbf Y}}\\)) exactly match the training values \\({\\textbf Y}\\). This is not possible because our data points don’t all lie on a single line. The next best thing therefore is to find parameter values such that the loss is the lowest value possible.\nWe thus want our loss function to have the following reasonable properties:\n\nIt must measure the distance between the prediction and the correct value. If the predictions are far off, the loss needs to be higher.\nEach training example must contribute to the loss.\n\nWe can thus derive the following loss function:\n\\[\nL(\\theta, {\\textbf X}, {\\textbf Y}) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n} (Y_i - \\theta_0 + \\theta_1 X_i)^2\n\\]\n\ndef loss(X, Y, θ):\n    return ((Y - prediction(X, θ)) ** 2).sum()\n\nWhy are we squaring each of the terms? Why aren’t we just using the absolute value of the difference? I’m sure there are many reasons for it, but one of them is that we are going to differentiate this function to find its minimum."

If you imagine the loss function as a 3d surface (in this case it looks like a bowl), we start somewhere on that surface and continuously try to move downhill.\nRecall that the derivative of a function is how much its value changes when its input changes by a little bit. If the derivative at a point is positive, it means a small positive change in the input causes the function to increase. If the derivative is negative, a small positive change in the input causes the function to decrease.\nThus if our goal is to minimize \\(L(\\theta)\\), we should modify each parameter at each step by an amount that’s proportional to the derivative of the loss, but negated. Since there are many parameters we want the partial derivative of the loss with respect to each parameter, and all these derivatives considered together is the gradient.\nWe can derive expressions for the gradient by normal calculus:\n\\[\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\theta_0} &=& \\sum_{i = 0}^{n} 2 ({\\hat y}_i - y_i) \\\\\n\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\theta_1} &=& \\sum_{i = 0}^{n} 2 \\cdot ({\\hat y}_i - y_i) \\cdot x_i \\\\\n\\end{eqnarray}\\]\nIn code we’ll call this the full_gradient, since we’re using the entire dataset to compute it.

Picking the right value of λ is a topic on its own, but for this example I just did trial and error until I found a learning rate that works.\nThe descend function also does a couple of other things: (1) record the value of the loss periodically (2) bail out when the loss starts to converge.\n\ndef descend(gradient, λ):\n    θ = np.array([-1.0, 1.0])    # Initial values of params, picked arbitrarily.\n    iters = []\n    losses = []\n\n    l = loss(X, Y, θ)\n    for i in range(100000):\n        prev_loss = l\n        l = loss(X, Y, θ)\n\n        # Bail out if the loss has converged\n        if i &gt; 1 and abs(prev_loss - l) &lt; 1e-6:\n            iters.append(i)\n            losses.append(l)\n            break\n\n        # Record progress\n        if i == 1 or i % 100 == 0:\n            iters.append(i)\n            losses.append(l)\n\n        # Compute gradient and update params\n        δ = full_gradient(X, Y, θ, i)\n        θ = θ - λ * δ\n\n    return θ, (iters, losses)\n\nRunning the descent gives:\n\ndef run_descent(g, λ):\n    θ, (iters, losses) = descend(g, λ)\n    for i in range(len(iters)):\n        print(f\"i = {iters[i]:&lt;12} loss {losses[i]:&gt;12.8f}\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nLearned parameters: {θ}\")\n    return θ, (iters, losses)\n\nθ_full, trace_full = run_descent(full_gradient, 0.00001)\n\ni = 0            loss 785.20179039\ni = 1            loss 760.98085472\ni = 100          loss  34.67684647\ni = 200          loss   2.04681446\ni = 300          loss   0.62813506\ni = 400          loss   0.56640872\ni = 500          loss   0.56367921\ni = 564          loss   0.56354384\n\nLearned parameters: [0.00303936 1.04948881]"

A real-world neural network like GPT-3 has 175 billion parameters, the vectors involved have dimensions in the tens of thousands, and the number of training examples is in the billions. It would be practically impossible to train a model like that by computing the full gradient on each iteration.\nThe optimization methods used to train such models are far more sophisticated (e.g., Adam) but they retain the core idea that a fuzzy estimate of the gradient derived from a subset of the data is enough to reach an acceptable minimum of the loss function."
