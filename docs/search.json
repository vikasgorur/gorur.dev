    "text": "This annotation is for the paper (Li 2022)\n\n\n\nLast updated: Oct 7, 2024.\n\nThere are two fundamental approaches to language modeling: one based on probability theory and the other based on language theory (grammars).\nA language model is a probability distribution defined on a word (token) sequence. More seriously, the probability of a given sequence of words \\(w_1, w_2, ..., w_N\\) is the product of successive conditional probabilities:\n\nprobability of the second word given the first\nprobability of the third word given the first and second\nand so on\n\n\\[\np(w_1, w_2, ..., w_N) = \\prod_{i=1}^{N} p(w_i | w_1, w_2, ..., w_{i-1})\n\\]\nMarkov invented the concept of Markov processes when studying language. See (Hayes 2013) for a fascinating history of how he analyzed the text of Pushkin’s Eugene Onegin by hand.\nAn \\(n\\)-gram language model assumes that the probability of a word depends only on the words at the previous \\(n - 1\\) positions. This kind of model is a Markov chain of the order \\(n - 1\\).\nShannon (1948) defined the concepts of entropy and cross-entropy. The cross-entropy is a measure of how well the model has learned the “true” probability. What is this true probability? I think it’s just the probability computed using frequencies in the training corpus.\nThe other approach to language modeling was the hierarchy of grammars proposed by Chomsky in 1956. This is not at all influential anymore. Chomsky thought that finite state grammars (like n-gram models) are limited and that context-free grammars can model language more effectively.\nYoshua Bengio (2003) (Turing Award 2018) first used neural networks for language modeling. Their paper had two key ideas:\n\nWords (tokens) have a “distributed representation” as vectors. This is the embedding.\nThe language model is a neural network.\n\nThe number of parameters of this model is of the order \\(O(V)\\) where \\(V\\) is the size of the vocabulary.\nThe next step in neural language modeling was the use of recurrent neural networks (RNNs). See Karpathy (2015) on their “unreasonable effectiveness”.\nA “conditional” language model calculates probability of word sequence under the condition of a previous sequence. These are the seq2seq models. These models can do tasks such as machine translation where the input and output are both sequences of tokens.\nSeq2seq models led to the transformer and pre-trained language models. A pre-trained model:\n\nUses a large corpus to do unsupervised learning to train the parameters.\nThe model is then fine-tuned with a small number of examples to adapt the model to a specific task.\n\nThis paper claims that language models don’t have reasoning, only association. I think that claim stopped being true mere months after this paper was published.\nIt is known that human language understanding is based on representations of concepts in many modes: visual, auditory, tactile, olfactory. Can AI language models learn from multiple modes as well?\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nHayes, Brian. 2013. “First Links in the Markov Chain.” American Scientist 101 (2). https://doi.org/10.1511/2013.101.92.\n\n\nKarpathy, Andrej. 2015. “The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks.” https://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/.\n\n\nLi, Hang. 2022. “Language Models: Past, Present, and Future.” Communications of the ACM 65 (7). https://cacm.acm.org/research/language-models/.\n\n\nShannon, Claude E. 1948. “A Mathematical Theory of Communication.” Bell System Technical Journal 27. https://people.math.harvard.edu/~ctm/home/text/others/shannon/entropy/entropy.pdf.\n\n\nYoshua Bengio, Pascal Vincent, Rejean Ducharme. 2003. “A Neural Probabilistic Language Model.” Journal of Machine Learning Research 3 (Feb). http://www.jmlr.org/papers/v3/bengio03a.html."

Each of the 12 phone calls can independently happen on any of the 7 days, so the total number of ways to distribute the phone calls is \\(7^{12}\\).\nWe want each day to have atleast one phone call, so let’s first choose 7 out of 12 calls and distribute them one per day. The number of ways to do this is: \\({12 \\choose 7} \\cdot 7!\\). Each of the remaining 5 calls can happen on any of the 7 days, so the number of ways is \\(7^5\\). Putting it all together the probability we want is:\n\\[\n\\frac{{12 \\choose 7} \\cdot 7! \\cdot 7^5}{7^{12}}\n\\]\nimport math\n\nmath.comb(12, 7) * math.factorial(7) * 7**5 / 7**12\n\n4.846960025159585\nWell, that’s not right.

    "text": "Problem: how long will this job run?\nA note about finding problems. When I used to endlessly consume ML textbooks, videos, blog posts, I always came away a bit dissatisfied and feeling like I hadn’t really learned anything. Will the method I just learned work on anything other than the Iris dataset from 1936? Learning that way skipped over one of the hard parts of doing ML: figuring out what kind of model would even work for a given problem. If you have felt the same way, I encourage you to find problems and datasets from your own life, or atleast find a different dataset on your own and try to apply your newly learned techniques to it.\nFor this post I’ve assembled a dataset from a problem I encountered myself. Assume there is an ML training job that you want to run on datasets of varying sizes. It’s not important what the job does. The only intuition we need is the reasonable expectation that the running time of the job is proportional to the number of training examples in a given run. We can scatter plot the data and confirm this intuition.\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\nmetrics = pd.read_csv(\"data/metrics.csv\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven that we have one continuous input variable n and we wish to predict another continuous variable duration, the simplest model to try is a line that is closest to all the points. For reasons of convention we’ll denote our input as the vector \\({\\textbf X}\\) and the output as the vector \\({\\textbf Y}.\\)\n(Note that we’re scaling both \\({\\textbf X}\\) and \\({\\textbf Y}\\) values to be in the range \\([0, 1]\\). This is necessary for most ML algorithms to work well, but I don’t understand it deeply enough to explain in this post.)\n\ndef scale(v):\n    return (v - v.min()) / (v.max() - v.min())\n\n\nX = scale(metrics[\"n\"].to_numpy())\nY = scale(metrics[\"duration\"].to_numpy())\n\nNow we can write our model as:\n\\[\n{\\textbf Y} = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1 {\\textbf X}\n\\]\nIn Python:\n\ndef prediction(X, θ):\n    return θ[0] + θ[1] * X\n\nNote that we’re multiplying a vector X with a scalar θ[1]. This works because NumPy supports broadcasting; see notes at the end of this post."

    "text": "Learning the parameters\nThe model above describes an infinite number of lines. To find a specific line that best fits the available data, we need to find the values of \\(\\theta_0\\) and \\(\\theta_1\\). We’re also making the assumption that such a line will help us predict the output variable on unseen future data. For more complicated models this is not true by default and special measures need to be taken to reduce overfitting.\nHow can we find the parameter values? The answer is one of the most important ideas in ML:\nThe parameters of a model are found by minimizing a loss function.\nThe loss function (also called the cost or objective) is a measure of how well a model fits its training data. Thus it is a function of both the parameters of the model and the training data.\nIn our problem we want the loss value to be 0 if the prediction values (denote as \\({\\hat {\\textbf Y}}\\)) exactly match the training values \\({\\textbf Y}\\). This is not possible because our data points don’t all lie on a single line. The next best thing therefore is to find parameter values such that the loss is the lowest value possible.\nWe thus want our loss function to have the following reasonable properties:\n\nIt must measure the distance between the prediction and the correct value. If the predictions are far off, the loss needs to be higher.\nEach training example must contribute to the loss.\n\nWe can thus derive the following loss function:\n\\[\nL(\\theta, {\\textbf X}, {\\textbf Y}) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n} (Y_i - \\theta_0 + \\theta_1 X_i)^2\n\\]\n\ndef loss(X, Y, θ):\n    return ((Y - prediction(X, θ)) ** 2).sum()\n\nWhy are we squaring each of the terms? Why aren’t we just using the absolute value of the difference? I’m sure there are many reasons for it, but one of them is that we are going to differentiate this function to find its minimum."

If you imagine the loss function as a 3d surface (in this case it looks like a bowl), we start somewhere on that surface and continuously try to move downhill.\nRecall that the derivative of a function is how much its value changes when its input changes by a little bit. If the derivative at a point is positive, it means a small positive change in the input causes the function to increase. If the derivative is negative, a small positive change in the input causes the function to decrease.\nThus if our goal is to minimize \\(L(\\theta)\\), we should modify each parameter at each step by an amount that’s proportional to the derivative of the loss, but negated. Since there are many parameters we want the partial derivative of the loss with respect to each parameter, and all these derivatives considered together is the gradient.\nWe can derive expressions for the gradient by normal calculus:\n\\[\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\theta_0} &=& \\sum_{i = 0}^{n} 2 ({\\hat y}_i - y_i) \\\\\n\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\theta_1} &=& \\sum_{i = 0}^{n} 2 \\cdot ({\\hat y}_i - y_i) \\cdot x_i \\\\\n\\end{eqnarray}\\]\nIn code we’ll call this the full_gradient, since we’re using the entire dataset to compute it.

    "text": "Last updated: Sep 1, 2024.\nOne of the simplest way to “encrypt” a piece of English text is the Caesar (rotational) cipher which shifts each letter by a fixed number of places in the alphabet with wrap around. A well-known example is rot13 where every letter is shifted by 13 places. So A -&gt; N, B -&gt; O and so on.\nI have often read that simple ciphers like this can be broken by “frequency analysis”, taking advantage of the observation that the frequencies of the various letters in English is well-known. But what exactly does that mean? How would such frequency analysis actually work?\nFirst, let’s write some code to encrypt and decrypt. For simplicity we’ll restrict our alphabet to just the uppercase letters A-Z and space and we’ll leave the space characters unchanged.

For reasons that will become clear later we’ll actually compute a probability mass function, which is just the frequencies divided by the total count of letters. We will represent the PMF as a dictionary that maps each letter of our alphabet to its probability.\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nLetterPmf = dict[str, float]\n\ndef letter_pmf(s: str) -&gt; LetterPmf:\n    s = s.upper()\n    counts = Counter(s)\n    total = sum(counts.values())\n    return {c: counts[c] / total for c in counts.keys()}\n\nletter_pmf(\n    \"So we beat on boats against the current\" +\n    \"borne back ceaselessly into the past\"\n)\n\n{'S': 0.09333333333333334,\n 'O': 0.06666666666666667,\n ' ': 0.16,\n 'W': 0.013333333333333334,\n 'E': 0.12,\n 'B': 0.05333333333333334,\n 'A': 0.09333333333333334,\n 'T': 0.10666666666666667,\n 'N': 0.06666666666666667,\n 'G': 0.013333333333333334,\n 'I': 0.02666666666666667,\n 'H': 0.02666666666666667,\n 'C': 0.04,\n 'U': 0.013333333333333334,\n 'R': 0.04,\n 'K': 0.013333333333333334,\n 'L': 0.02666666666666667,\n 'Y': 0.013333333333333334,\n 'P': 0.013333333333333334}\nA reasonable way to use letter frequencies to break the cipher is:\n(Ofcourse we could argue that this is all needlessly complicated. If we already know that the text has been encrypted with a Caesar cipher, we can just inspect the results of trying all 26 keys and surely all but one of them will look like gibberish. That’s true, but in this post we’re more interested in teaching a computer to do that work for us.)\nLet’s use the complete Sherlock Holmes canon as a stand-in for the English language as a whole and compute the letter PMF.\ndef clean_text(s: str) -&gt; str:\n    return \"\".join([c for c in s if c.isalpha() or c == \" \"]).upper()\n\nHOLMES = letter_pmf(clean_text(open(\"data/holmes.txt\").read()))\nFor a moment let’s assume we have a way to measure how close two frequency distributions are and call it pmf_distance.

    "text": "Relative entropy\nThe Shannon information content of an event \\(x\\) with probability \\(P(x)\\) is defined as \\(log(1 / P(x))\\). This captures the intuition that the information obtainable from an event is proportional to how surprising it is. If you have a dog that barks at everything it’s not a very good guard dog because the bark tells you nothing and thus has low information content.\nThe entropy of a probability distribution is the sum of the information content of its events, weighted by the probability of each event.\n\\[\nH(x) = \\sum_{x_i} P(x_i) \\space log_2 \\frac{1}{P(x_i)}\n\\]\nThis too makes intuitive sense. For example, imagine a light that can be in two states on or off with equal probability. The entropy of this distribution is:\n\n0.5 * math.log2(1/0.5) + 0.5 * math.log2(1/0.5)\n\n1.0\n\n\nIn other words, the state of the light gives you 1 bit of information.\nThe relative entropy of a distribution \\(P(x)\\) compared to another distribution \\(Q(x)\\) captures some notion of the extra information we get from \\(P\\). Unfortunately the intuitive derivation of this is not at all clear to me so we’ll just have to trust the textbooks. The relative entropy is defined as:\n\\[\nD(P, Q) = \\sum_{x_i} P(x_i) \\space log_2 \\frac{P(x_i)}{Q(x_i)}\n\\]\n\ndef relative_entropy(p: LetterPmf, q: LetterPmf) -&gt; float:\n    return sum(p[x] * (math.log2(p[x]) - math.log2(q[x])) for x in p.keys())\n\nWe can also think of this as an informal kind of “distance” between \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\), while remembering that it’s not a true distance in the mathematical sense because it’s not symmetric (\\(D(P, Q) \\neq D(Q, P)\\) in general) and it doesn’t satisfy a few other distance-like properties. This distance is also known as the Kullback-Leibler divergence, a name that tells you nothing while being needlessly scary-looking.\nWe can try the decryption again, this time using the relative entropy as the distance between the distribution for each attempted decryption and the distribution for the English language:\n\npmf_distance = relative_entropy\ntry_decrypt(SECRET)[1]\n\n'SO WE BEAT ON BOATS AGAINST THE CURRENT BORNE BACK CEASELESSLY INTO THE PAST'\n\n\nWe can also visualize the relative entropy for each of the candidate keys to get a sense of how the frequency distribution with the correct key is so obviously different from that for all the wrong keys. We’ll plot the reciprocal of the distance just to make the graph prettier."

    "title": "How to do Feature Flag-Driven Development",
    "section": "Why use feature flags?",
    "text": "Why use feature flags?\nThis post assumes that you’re following the continuous delivery model of a single master branch into which all changes are merged.\nThe process of adding features to a SaaS application is a pipeline: product/engineering spec → code review/merge/test → QA/documentation. In any company of a reasonable size there will be multiple such pipelines active at any given time. A successful engineering organization must be able to deliver many new features quickly while not compromising on the quality of the product.\nLet us consider an example of a medium sized feature that requires changes on the backend and frontend, and which might take 3-4 weeks to move through the pipeline. In a development model that doesn’t use feature flags, we usually have to maintain a feature branch on both the backend and frontend for the entire 3-4 week period and they need to be merged and deployed together. This model has a number of problems:\n\nCode review is hard: Since the changes cannot be merged to master, it’s harder to break up the feature into small, incremental pull requests. This forces us to review the entire feature at once.\nTesting is hard: It might be too complicated to setup a new staging environment for each feature branch, thus testing would be restricted to whatever is possible to do locally. This is especially hard if your product has many third-party integrations.\nMerging is hard: When the engineer is ready to merge their code into the master branch, they might discover that changes merged by others in the intervening period cause conflicts. This problem gets worse the longer the feature remains in development. Resolving the complicated merge conflicts can easily lead to bugs being introduced.\nDocumentation is hard: If non-engineering teams such as Product Marketing or Customer Success wish to understand a feature, they have to wait until it’s in production or figure out how to use the specific test environment setup for that feature. This increases friction and causes delays.\nDeployment is risky: The frontend and backend changes often have a strict dependency and must be deployed together. If we forget this and only deploy one of them, it can lead to production issues. The feature also goes live for all customers at once, which means if something goes wrong it affects everyone.\n\nIn summary, trying to do continuous delivery without using feature flags makes the whole process a rigid and tightly coupled. Things must happen in a certain order and the stakeholders must co-ordinate closely. It’s an “all-in” jump from state A to state B, as in the diagram below:\n\nIn the feature flag model of development, enabling a flag causes the app to split into two versions, A and B. One segment of users continue to see the old version of the app, A, while another segment starts seeing the new version B. The proportions of these segments is slowly adjusted until no users see version A. At this point the flag can be removed from the codebase and as a consequence the app merges back into a single version, C. Obviously this happens to every feature flag that’s defined in the system, thus if there are \\(n\\) flags active at a given time, there could be upto \\(2^n\\) versions of the app in production. This can sound overwhelming but as long as the product areas controlled by these flags don’t overlap too much, the effective number of “different” versions is much smaller than \\(2^n\\).\n\nThis model of development is much more flexible and loosely coupled, and brings with it many benefits:\n\nCode review is easier: A feature can be split into multiple pull requests that can be reviewed and merged independently. Since everything is behind a feature flag, deploying these PRs to production has no effect until the flag is turned on.\nTesting is easier: Testing can be done in the standard staging environment or even in production, by turning on the feature for a single user. This is especially useful for testing things that have real-world interactions, like moving money.\nMerging is trivial: Merge conflicts are rare because there are no long-lived branches that have diverged from master.\nDocumentation is easier: The non-engineering teams can try the feature on staging or on production even while testing on the feature is still ongoing.\nDeployment is less risky: There is no dependency among backend and frontend deployments. Risky or large features (for example, shipping checks) can be rolled out slowly and tweaked based on real-world experience."

    "text": "When to use a flag\nAs a rule of thumb, something should be put behind a feature flag if it’s substantial, user-visible, or risky.\n\nSubstantial: If a change is really small, putting it behind a feature flag is not worth the trouble. A good rule of thumb might be: if the entire change can be a single pull request that’s no more than a few pages long, it doesn’t need to be behind a feature flag.\nUser-visible: If a change is invisible to the user and doesn’t modify any existing behavior, it doesn’t need a feature flag. Examples of such changes are refactors, backwards-compatible API changes, addition of new API endpoints, etc.\nRisky: Feature flags are primarily a tool to mitigate risk. So any change that where the cost of a bug is high should be gated behind a feature flag. This is especially important for changes that cannot be fully tested in staging environments."

    "text": "Diverge at the highest level\nAll feature flags need to be cleaned up eventually, thus it’s best to minimize the number of places where a flag is evaluated and behavior diverges. It is worth paying attention to this aspect both when writing the product/engineering spec as well as when writing code. A few examples:\n\nIt is easier to put an entire screen or a tab behind a flag rather than parts of it.\nIt is easier to add a new endpoint and deprecate the old one than trying to make the same endpoint exhibit two kinds of behavior.\nIt’s better to add new model methods, or write a new background job than add flag checks throughout the body of those methods and jobs.\n\nCode duplication is okay. Minimizing the number of if (flag) checks reduces the number of possible states we have to keep in our heads, leading to higher quality code. A temporary increase in duplicate code is an easy price to pay for it."

Now let’s say there’s a requirement to track more information than just “is finished or not?” — we want a concert to have three states: NOT_STARTED, IN_PROGRESS, FINISHED. How do we do this without a single breaking change?\nStep 1: Add the new write path\nWe add a new field state to the class and change all write paths to update both the old is_finished field and the new state field. No code is reading the new field yet. We also run a migration on the production DB to set the value of state for all existing concerts.\nclass Concert:\n    ...\n    is_finished = BooleanField()\n    state = ChoiceField(choices=[\"NOT_STARTED\", \"IN_PROGRESS\", \"FINISHED\")\nStep 2: Start reading/writing, deploy the feature\nMake changes across the codebase to start using the state field instead of the old field. This step is when we actually develop and deploy the new feature that required us to do the data model change. Most of these changes will be behind a flag.\nStep 3: Clean up\nOnce all customers are going through the new code path, remove the feature flag and remove the is_finished field entirely.\nclass Concert:\n    ...\n    state = ChoiceField(choices=[\"NOT_STARTED\", \"IN_PROGRESS\", \"FINISHED\")\nThis is a very specific example but the 3-step pattern is generally applicable. Most 1-step breaking changes can be redesigned into this 3-step shape to facilitate use of a feature flag."

However, I’ve also found that it’s ok to “lazy-load” the required math once you’ve acquired a decent intuition in each of the major areas. This section therefore is just going to be a list of the areas of math that can be helpful and the best resources I’ve found for learning them.\nEver since I discovered computers my identity has been “programmer”. The book by (jeremy_kun_programmers_2021?) changed my relationship to math and gave me the confidence to read the ML textbooks and papers. It helped me reconnect with my teenage self that found math playful and was excited by it rather than scared by notation. This is a life-changing book.\n\nProbability\nProbability is the foundation for all of ML, statistics, and science. It’s also way more complicated than our brief encounter with it in high school or college makes us believe. I’m always on the look out for books and articles that help in developing a good intuition for probability.\nThe textbook by (hamming_art_1991?) is one of the best introductions. It is rigorous enough for us engineers but more importantly has long passages that explain the intuition behind ideas.\n\n\nInformation Theory\nInformation seems like the most natural concept to try to understand ML and stats. Many of the questions of interest can be posed as information theory questions: “what has a model learnt?”, or “what did this experiment tell us?”, “how much can a model of a certain size learn?”\n(cover_elements_2005?) and (mackay_information_2003?) are two useful textbooks.\n\n\nLinear Algebra\nLinear Algebra has the worst branding in all of math. It’s more exciting to think of the subject as “thinking in high-dimensional spaces”. Everything in ML deals with vectors with impossibly high dimensions (for example, each token in GPT3 is represented as a vector in a ~50,000 dimension space).\nThe video series “Essence of Linear Algebra” by (3blue1brown_essence_2016?) was the first time linear algebra made any intuitive sense to me.\n\n\nCalculus\nML papers are full of complicated equations with symbols from multivariate and matrix calculus. This might give the impression that one needs a full undergrad course in these topics before making any progress, but I don’t buy it. I think one can get by for a long time with just the intuition of the concept of a derivative (gradient) for complicated functions and the chain rule for computing them."

From that perspective, current LLMs running on GPUs are just one physical realization of the model of computation.\nThe key algorithm for training neural networks is backpropagation. This algorithm has apparently been invented independently many times. (rumelhart_learning_1986?) is one of the widely cited descriptions of it.\n(lecun_backpropagation_1989?) is one of the first examples of using neural networks and back propagation to solve the recognizably modern problem of handwriting recognition. An interesting companion piece is the blog post (karpathy_deep_2022?) that re-implements the network described in the original paper and illustrates the massive difference in training time made possible by modern hardware.\nAnother milestone in the deep learning revolution is AlexNet (krizhevsky_imagenet_2012?) where a deep learning model beat all other previous computer vision models on image recognition by a significant margin. This paper also illustrates the coming together of three factors that make deep learning practical and are true to this day: (1) massive datasets (2) GPUs for efficient matrix computations (3) libraries to do automatic differentiation easily."

The distribution is the conditional probability of the next token given a sequence of previous tokens. A short introduction to language modeling is in (hang_li_language_2022?).\nThe roots of this go back to Markov analyzing Pushkin’s poetry to settle a debate about free will(!), described in the article by (hayes_first_2013?).\nThe classic (shannon_mathematical_1948?) paper that invented information theory also considers language modeling, as does his subsequent paper (shannon_prediction_1951?). In the second paper he describes an experiment to figure out the entropy of English language by giving humans (his wife and another couple) the task of predicting the next word of a short sentence, essentially treating them like modern LLMs!\nThe Shannon living-room experiments story is related in this entertaining profile: (horgan_claude_1992?)."

    "text": "How is language modeling done with neural networks?\n(bengio_neural_2003?) introduced the ideas of using a neural network to model language as well as the idea of a “distributed representation”, also known as word embeddings. The goal of embedding is to turn words and phrases into vectors in a high-dimensional space.\nA big step forward in embeddings was Google’s word2vec paper (mikolov_distributed_2013?), which contained the famous example vec(\"King\") - vec(\"Man\") + vec(\"Woman\") ~= vec(\"Queen\"). Embeddings just on their own are an incredibly useful tool in building products because they capture a general notion of semantic “distance” between words, sentences, or entire documents.\nRecurrent Neural Nets (RNNs) were one solution to the problem of capturing the sequential nature of language. The historical roots of this approach are in the cognitive science paper (elman_finding_1990?). The blog post (andrej_karpathy_unreasonable_2015?) illustrates the “unreasonable effectiveness” of RNNs.\nThe playlist “Neural Networks: Zero to Hero” (karpathy_neural_2022?) is a step-by-step walkthrough to building something like GPT-2 starting from nothing but knowledge of Python. This entire post is in a sense is all the supplementary reading I’m doing to finish understanding all the videos in this playlist."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Last updated: Nov 27, 2024.\nThese are interesting things mentioned in Why Machines Learn: The Elegant Maths behind Modern AI, Ananthaswamy (2024).\nImprinting: Konrad Lorenz discovered that ducklings imprint on the first moving thing they see after hatching. More interestingly, they can imprint on relations. If upon birth they see two moving red objects, they will later follow two objects of the same color, even if the color is different. More about this in his Nobel lecture (Konrad Lorenz 1973a) and biography (Konrad Lorenz 1973b).\nThe first artificial neuron: The paper about the first artificial neuron was a collaboration between McCulloch, a professor in his mid-40s and Pitts, a teenage prodigy who was hanging around a university and was adopted into the McCulloch home. The paper itself (McCulloch and Pitts 1943) is impenetrable, written in a formal math style reminiscient of Principia Mathematica. The important conclusion though is that combinations of the artificial neuron can implement any boolean logic.\nHebbian learning can be understood as the memorable phrase “neurons that fire together, wire together”.\nThe Mark I perceptron was a hardware implementation that could recognize handwritten characters from a 20x20 image. It was a 3-layer neural network, although only one layer had adjustable weights (in hardware, using DC motors to drive potentiometers, essentially volume knobs!). The operator’s manual (Hay, Lynch, and Smith 1960) has all the fascinating details.\nWilliam Rowan Hamilton discovered quaternions and etched it on a bridge in Dublin. He’s also responsible for notions of “scalar” and “vector”.\nA hyperplane, such as the one learnt by a perceptron, can be uniquely described by a vector that is orthogonal to it. This is in fact the vector of weights, \\(w\\).\nThe perceptron learning rule is simple, but it’s remarkable that it always converges if the dataset is linearly separable. The lecture notes (Kilian Weinberger 2024) have an accessible proof of this theorem, also reproduced in the book.\nWhen two dialup modems are trying to establish a connection they send a pre-agreed signal that lets them configure (learn) an adaptive filter to filter out the noise particular to that line. This is some of the weird sounds we used to hear! The course notes in (UC Berkeley 2011) have more details.\nAdaptive filters use the mean-squared error (MSE) as the cost function. When reading about linear regression I’ve always wondered why we can’t just use the absolute difference. One reason to prefer MSE is that it’s differentiable everywhere. Another reason mentioned in this book is that the MSE punishes outliers much more than the absolute difference.\nThe idea of stochastic gradient descent was already invented by the ADALINE project at Stanford in the 60s, which tried to solve some of the same problems as the perceptron machine.\nPaul Erdős wasn’t convinced at first that switching doors in the Monty Hall problem was the right solution. There is hope for all of us!\nBayesian statistics was used by Frederick Mosteller and David Wallace in the 1940s to figure out the authorship of The Federalist Papers.\nA concise way to remember Principal Component Analysis (PCA): The eigenvectors of a covariance matrix are the principal components of the original data matrix.\nThe support vector machine (SVM) overcomes the linear separability limitation of the perceptron. It finds an optimal separating hyperplane by projecting the dataset to a much higher dimension and finding a plane there. The algorithm to find this hyperplane works by minimizing a cost function related to the weight vector while simultaneously satisfying a set of constraints, one per data point.\nConstrained optimization required by SVMs uses something called the technique of Lagrange multipliers. It consists of defining a new function, the Lagrange function, that encodes all the constraints and then finding the extrema of it.\nThe optimal separating hyperplane of the SVM depends only on the dot produces of a few “support vectors” that anchor the margin, hence the name. However, computing the dot products in higher dimensions can be expensive (this is not very convincing to me – is it still true?). The solution is to use the kernel trick.\nA kernel is a function such that given two vectors \\(x_i\\) and \\(x_j\\) and a function \\(\\phi(x)\\) that transforms each vector to a higher dimension, the kernel \\(K(x)\\) allows one to compute the dot product in the higher dimension while only working with the lower-dimension vectors:\n\\[\nK(x_i, x_j) = \\phi(x_i) \\cdot \\phi(x_j)\n\\] The kernel trick was suggested by a French scientist Isabelle Guyon, working with Bernard Boser and Vladimir Vapnik. The trick apparently can work even when projecting to an infinite dimensional space, called a Hilbert space. The kernel in that case is called the “radial basis function” (RBF).\nAn RBF kernel can always find a linearly separable hyperplane in some infinite-dimensional space. This means that SVMs are also universal function approximators, just like deep neural networks.\nThe original SVM paper is (Boser, Guyon, and Vapnik 1992).\nGlass is a disordered solid — without an ordered crystalline structure yet not a liquid. By analogy, certain magnetic materials that have atoms or ions with randomly oriented magnetic moments (which arise due to ‘spin’) are called spin glasses.\nA simple mathematical model of spin glasses assumes that the spin of each element in a 2d or 3d array depends only on the spins of its neighbors. If such a material starts out in an arbitrary state, the spins will flip until the entire system reaches the state of lowest energy, which happens when the spins are all aligned.\nThe physicist John Hopfield (Nobel in Physics, 2024) was thinking about the problem of associative memory. How is it that when given a fragment of an image or a hint of a smell, we can recall an entire vivid memory?\nThe solution was the Hopfield network. The connections in such a network are arranged similarly to the spin glasses. For a given configuration, the weights of the neurons represent the “memory” of the network. If the memory puts the network into its lowest energy state, any distorted (noisy) version of the same memory would put the network in a higher energy state. The network however can find its way back to the lowest energy state through a dynamical process, like any physical system finding its equilibrium. Thus we can think of the Hopfield network as a system that stores a memory and can retrieve that memory when given a fragment of it.\nHopfield could only publish his paper (Hopfield 1982) because he was a member of the Academy of Sciences and thus had privileges to publish without peer review. “No refereed journal would have accepted it”. 🙃\nGeorge Cybenko proved in 1989 that a neural network with just one hidden layer and an arbitrarily large number of neurons can approximate any function. This is the universal approximation theorem.\nThe proof uses the idea that functions are vectors in an infinite dimensional space. It’s not a constructive proof but one by contradiction. It assumes that a network with a single hidden layer cannot span the entire vector space of functions and arrives at a contradiction.\nA deterministic algorithm for updating the weights of a neural network suffers from the problem of symmetry. If the initial weights are all assigned the same value (say, 0), they will be updated by the learning rule in the same way and thus effectively become redundant. The simple way to solve this problem is to initialize the weights randomly, an idea that first occured to Rumelhart.\nThe backprop paper (Rumelhart, Hinton, and Williams 1986) was the “last time” it was discovered. See (Liu 2023) for a detailed history of backpropagation.\nDavid Hubel and Torsten Wiesel did experiments on cats and figured out essentially that the neurons in the brain respond to certain “features” in the visual field, like edges.\nYann LeCun at Bell Labs in 1988 designed a neural network to recognize handwritten digits from a US Postal Service dataset (is this the origin of the famous MNIST dataset?). He wrote a compiler in Lisp that would take the architecture of a neural network and generate C code to implement it.\nHis network, LeNet, was a convolutional neural network. A 2d convolution of an image involves moving a small kernel (say 4x4) over the pixels of the image and generating a new pixel through some operation (say, average or max). The end result of this is a slightly smaller image. While these kernels could be handcrafted, it’s more scalable to let the neural net learn them. This is how a neural net learns which features are important.\nIn 2009, Fei-Fei Li presented an immense dataset of labeled images, ImageNet and an associated challenge. Use the 1.2 million images, binned into 1000 categories, to train an algorithm and test it on 100,000 unseen images. AlexNet, using GPUs for training won the contest in 2012 by a wide margin, kicking off the modern deep learning revolution.\nGrokking is a rather strange properly of deep neural networks. The cutting edge models today have parameters in the billions or trillions, sometimes outnumbering the instances of data used to train them. In theory these networks should simply overfit the data and not generalize, but that’s not true.\nOne hypothesis is that some kind of implicit regularization is happening in the training process. See also the illuminating short paper (Breiman 2018) that questions the usefulness of “theory” when doing ML research.\nLLMs are an instance of self-supervised learning. The pre-training helps the network learn some structure of language (or images, speech, …) and fine-tuning later guides them towards a purpose.\nThe theory of all this is far, far behind experimentation.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nAnanthaswamy, Anil. 2024.
