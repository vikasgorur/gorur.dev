There is a simple but powerful idea at the heart of all of Machine Learning. It is considered so obvious that many books and courses treat it as an after-thought. The idea is this:

> All real-world data can be thought of as points in a high-dimensional space.

When you understand this it's like realizing that everything in your computer is stored as bits.

In this post we will explore the power of this idea by applying the same simple ML algorithm to
different kinds of vectors.

## Nearest neighbors

Describe the Wifi dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/422/wireless+indoor+localization

Signal strength of 7 access points, collected in two rooms.
We will use a simplified version with only `w5` and `w7`.


## Recipes

Plan:
- Filter dataset to only 2 or 3 cuisines
- Describe only the bag of words encoder
