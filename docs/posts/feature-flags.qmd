# Introduction

Feature flags are a set of development patterns that allow writing web apps that behave differently for certain segments of users. This document provides a rationale for using feature flags and recommends a set of best practices for development.

## Why use feature flags?

*This document assumes that we're following the continuous delivery model of a single master branch into which all changes are merged.*

The process of adding features to a SaaS application is a pipeline: product/engineering spec → code review/merge/test → QA/documentation. In any company of a reasonable size there will be multiple such pipelines active at any given time. A successful engineering organization must be able to deliver many new features quickly while not compromising on the quality of the product.

Let us consider an example of a medium sized feature that requires changes on the backend and frontend, and which might take 3-4 weeks to move through the pipeline. In a development model that doesn't use feature flags, we usually have to maintain a feature branch on both the backend and frontend for the entire 3-4 week period and they need to be merged and deployed together. This model has a number of problems:

- **Code review is hard**: Since the changes cannot be merged to master, it's harder to break up the feature into small, incremental pull requests. This forces us to review the entire feature at once.
- **Testing is hard**: The changes cannot be tested in the regular staging environment since they're on a separate branch. Thus we must setup a new environment (a Heroku review app) just for that branch, which can be time-consuming and in some cases impossible (for example, if the code involves receiving webhooks from an external service).
- **Merging is hard**: When the engineer is ready to merge their code into the master branch, they might discover that changes merged by others in the intervening period cause conflicts. This problem gets worse the longer the feature remains in development. Resolving the complicated merge conflicts can easily lead to bugs being introduced.
- **Documentation is hard**:  If the product marketing or customer success teams wish to understand a feature, they have to wait until it's in production or figure out how to use the specific test environment setup for that feature. This increases friction and causes delays.
- **Deployment is risky**: The frontend and backend changes often have a strict dependency and must be deployed together. If we forget this and only deploy one of them, it can lead to production issues. The feature also goes live for all customers at once, which means if something goes wrong it affects everyone.

In summary, trying to do continuous delivery without using feature flags makes the whole process a **rigid and tightly coupled.** Things must happen in a certain order and the stakeholders must co-ordinate closely. It's an "all-in" jump from state **A** to state **B**, as in the diagram below:

![How%20to%20do%20Feature%20Flag-Driven%20Development%20f9ce8e349b1f47d680a8a3ce6216fe4d/Untitled_Document.png](How%20to%20do%20Feature%20Flag-Driven%20Development%20f9ce8e349b1f47d680a8a3ce6216fe4d/Untitled_Document.png)

In the feature flag model of development, enabling a flag causes the app to split into two versions, **A** and **B**. One segment of users continue to see the old version of the app, **A**, while another segment starts seeing the new version**, B**. The proportions of these segments is slowly adjusted until no users see version **A**. At this point the flag can be removed from the codebase and as a consequence the app merges back into a single version, **C**. Obviously this happens to *every* feature flag that's defined in the system, thus if there are `n` flags active at a given time, there could be upto `2^n` versions of the app in production. This can sound overwhelming but as long as the product areas controlled by these flags don't overlap too much, the effective number of "different" versions is much smaller than `2^n`.

![How%20to%20do%20Feature%20Flag-Driven%20Development%20f9ce8e349b1f47d680a8a3ce6216fe4d/Untitled_Document_(1).png](How%20to%20do%20Feature%20Flag-Driven%20Development%20f9ce8e349b1f47d680a8a3ce6216fe4d/Untitled_Document_(1).png)

This model of development is much more **flexible** and **loosely coupled**, and brings with it many benefits:

- **Code review is easier**: A feature can be split into multiple pull requests that can be reviewed and merged independently. Since everything is behind a feature flag, deploying these PRs to production has no effect until the flag is turned on.
- **Testing is easier**: Testing can be done in the standard staging environment or even in production, by turning on the feature for a single company (our own). This is especially useful for testing things that have real-world interactions with card networks or ACH.
- **Merging is trivial:** Merge conflicts are rare because there are no long-lived branches that have diverged from master.
- **Documentation is easier:** The product marketing and customer success teams can try the feature on staging or on production even while testing on the feature is still ongoing.
- **Deployment is less risky**: There is no dependency among backend and frontend deployments. Risky or large features (for example, shipping checks) can be rolled out slowly and tweaked based on real-world experience.

# Designing for Feature Flags

Using feature flags effectively requires some thought during the design process. This section lists a few guiding principles for good design.

## When to use a flag

As a rule of thumb, something should be put behind a feature flag if it's **substantial**, **user-visible,** or **risky.**

- **Substantial**: If a change is really small, putting it behind a feature flag is not worth the trouble. A good rule of thumb might be: if the entire change can be a single pull request that's no more than a few pages long, it doesn't need to be behind a feature flag.
- **User-visible:** If a change is invisible to the user and doesn't modify any existing behavior, it doesn't need a feature flag. Examples of such changes are refactors, backwards-compatible API changes, addition of new API endpoints, etc.
    - A special case to highlight is the **irreversible migration**. For example, transitioning a customer from the non-gateway model to the gateway model is a migration that cannot be reversed (easily). Such changes definitely **should not** be behind a feature flag, to avoid the risk of someone accidentally flipping a flag for a company and putting it in an inconsistent state.
- **Risky**: Any change with real-world implications on money movement, GL impact, shipping, fraud should be behind a feature flag. These kinds of changes are nearly impossible to test in staging and thus we should be cautious and roll it out slowly to customers after gathering confidence in production.

## Diverge at the highest level

All feature flags need to be cleaned up eventually, thus it's best to minimize the number of places where a flag is evaluated and behavior diverges. It is worth paying attention to this aspect both when writing the product/engineering spec as well as when writing code. A few examples:

- It is easier to put an entire screen or a tab behind a flag rather than parts of it.
- It is easier to add a new endpoint and deprecate the old one than trying to make the same endpoint exhibit two kinds of behavior.
- It's better to add new model methods, or write a new background job than add flag checks throughout the body of those methods and jobs.

**Code duplication is okay**. Minimizing the number of `if (flag)` checks reduces the number of possible states we have to keep in our heads, leading to higher quality code. A temporary increase in duplicate code is an easy price to pay for it.

## The 3-step data model change

Let's say you have a DB model in your app called `Concert` that represents a musical event:

```python
class Concert:
	...
	is_finished = BooleanField()
```

There are already lots of endpoints and frontend code that consumes the `is_finished` field. Now let's say there's a requirement to track more information than just "is finished or not?" — we want a concert to have three states: `NOT_STARTED`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `FINISHED`. How do we do this without a single breaking change?

**Step 1**: **Add the new write path**

We add a new field `state` to the class and change all write paths to update both the old `is_finished` field and the new `state` field. No code is reading the new field yet. We also run a migration on the production DB to set the value of `state` for all existing concerts.

```python
class Concert:
	...
	is_finished = BooleanField()
	state = ChoiceField(choices=["NOT_STARTED", "IN_PROGRESS", "FINISHED")
```

**Step 2**: **Start reading/writing, deploy the feature**

Make changes across the codebase to start using the `state` field instead of the old field. This step is when we actually develop and deploy the new feature that required us to do the data model change. Most of these changes will be behind a flag.

**Step 3: Clean up**

Once all customers are going through the new code path, remove the feature flag and remove the `is_finished` field entirely.

```python
class Concert:
	...
	state = ChoiceField(choices=["NOT_STARTED", "IN_PROGRESS", "FINISHED")
```

This is a very specific example but the 3-step pattern is generally applicable. Most 1-step  breaking changes can be redesigned into this 3-step shape to facilitate use of a feature flag.

# Product Management

The following is a recommended workflow for product managers:

- When writing the product spec, identify the screens, background tasks and other behavior that should be behind the feature flag.
- Create the flag in LaunchDarkly and give it a descriptive name. Flags have descriptive name and a `name-like-this` to be used in the codebase. Enable the flag for all companies in staging, and no companies in production.
- Ensure that the engineering spec uses the same flag name.
- Test the feature in staging and roll it out in production as appropriate.
- Once the feature has been in production long enough, confirm that it has been turned on for all companies and add a task to the team's plan to remove the flag from the codebase.

## LaunchDarkly Segments

[LaunchDarkly segments](https://launchdarkly.com/blog/launched-segments-separate-your-users-into-reusable-segments/) allow creating a reusable set of targeting criteria. The Django backend app has a daily job that creates these segments automatically for every active company.

![How%20to%20do%20Feature%20Flag-Driven%20Development%20f9ce8e349b1f47d680a8a3ce6216fe4d/Untitled.png](How%20to%20do%20Feature%20Flag-Driven%20Development%20f9ce8e349b1f47d680a8a3ce6216fe4d/Untitled.png)

When enabling a flag for a company, create or modify a rule of the form "user is in segment: >list of segments>". Do not use numeric IDs of any sort, to avoid errors due to typos.

![How%20to%20do%20Feature%20Flag-Driven%20Development%20f9ce8e349b1f47d680a8a3ce6216fe4d/Untitled%201.png](How%20to%20do%20Feature%20Flag-Driven%20Development%20f9ce8e349b1f47d680a8a3ce6216fe4d/Untitled%201.png)

Segments also allow you to easily get the list of companies that have the flag turned on. Click on the name of a segment to see this:

# Writing Code

## Backend

The LaunchDarkly library can be imported as:

```python
from airbase_backend.launchdarkly import LDFlag, ld_client
```

When introducing a new flag to the codebase, add it to the `LDFlag` enum:

```python
class LDFlag(Enum):
    """
    All the feature flags used by us.

    These should be created on LaunchDarkly first before use.
    Locally they are handled via .env files.
    """

    BANK_PAYMENTS = "bank-payments"
    BILL_PAYMENTS_AMORTIZATION = "bill-payments-amortization"
    DEPARTMENT_REPORTING = "department-reporting"
		... # more flags
```

To check if a company has a feature enabled:

```python
if company.has_feature(LDFlag.BILL_PAYMENTS_AMORTIZATION):
	...
```

The backend `.env` has a config variable called `LAUNCH_DARKLY_FLAG_ENABLE_ALL=True` which enables all feature flags during local development. You can turn off a specific flag by adding a variable of the form `LAUNCH_DARKLY_FLAG_BILL_PAYMENTS_AMORTIZATION=False`

## Frontend

To add a new flag to the codebase, define a function in `src/app/utils/LaunchDarkly.js`, and use the function wherever necessary. The first argument `state` is the Redux state object.

```jsx
export function isBillPaymentsAmortizationEnabled(state) {
  return isFeatureEnabled(state, 'bill-payments-amortization')
}
```

The frontend `.env` file has a config variable called `REACT_APP_LD_FLAG_ENABLE_ALL=true` which enables all feature flags during local development. You can turn off a specific flag by adding a variable of the form `REACT_APP_LD_FLAG_BILL_PAYMENTS_AMORTIZATION=false`.

### Mobile

All Launch Darkly flags are fetched automatically on every app launch and every time when a flag changes. These flags are available in `launchDarkly` redux store.

To use flags in your code do the following

All Launch Darkly flags are fetched automatically on every app launch and every time when a flag changes. These flags are available in `launchDarkly` redux store.

To use flags in your code do the following

```jsx
//Add the flag as a constant in src/common/constants.js
export const FEATURE_FLAGS = {
	...
  YOUR_FEATURE: 'your-feature'
};

//Connect your redux state to component props 
const mapStateToProps = state => ({
	...
	flags: state.launchDarkly?.flags
})

//OR access the state from store object
import { store } from './src/common/store'
const state = store.getState();
const flags = state.launchDarkly?.flags;

//Check the flag like so
const yourFeature = _.get(flags, `${FEATURE_FLAGS.YOUR_FEATURE}`, false);
```
